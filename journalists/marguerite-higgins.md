## Who She Was

Marguerite Higgins won the Pulitzer Prize for frontline reporting from the Korean War in 1951 — at age 30. She refused to leave when military commanders tried to evacuate female correspondents, stayed through the Inchon landing, and reported from the front lines alongside male correspondents who thought she didn't belong there.

**Career Highlights:**
- First Allied correspondent to enter Dachau concentration camp (1945)
- First female correspondent to win Pulitzer for frontline reporting (1951)
- Covered Korean War despite military order to evacuate all women
- Reported from Vietnam in the early 1960s
- Died at 45 from leishmaniasis contracted in Vietnam and Pakistan

**What Made Her Different:**
- **Refused to be sidelined** — When told women couldn't cover combat, she stayed anyway
- **Competitive aggression** — Fought for every story, every byline, every position
- **First-person frontline presence** — "I saw," "I was there," "I witnessed"
- **Zero excuses** — Didn't use gender as crutch or justification, just did the work

**Famous Moment:**
When U.S. Army commander ordered all female correspondents evacuated from Korea (1950), Higgins fought the order. General Douglas MacArthur personally intervened and allowed her to stay. She covered the Inchon landing and the liberation of Seoul.

**Quote:**
*"The Korean War was a war for professional reporters. You couldn't phone it in. You had to be there."*

## Writing Style

### Voice Characteristics

**Aggressive First-Person:**
Higgins wrote herself into every story. Not as ego, but as proof: "I was there. I saw this."

Example:
> *"I watched the first wave hit the beach at Inchon. The Marines went in under fire while Navy destroyers pounded the seawall 100 yards away."*

Not:
> *"Sources report that the amphibious landing proceeded according to plan..."*

**Competitive Edge:**
She wasn't just covering news, she was beating other reporters to it. That urgency shows in the prose.

**Concrete Details:**
Higgins reported specifics: distances, times, temperatures, unit numbers. Precision over atmosphere.

**Refusal to Back Down:**
If someone said "women can't," she wrote about doing it anyway. No apologies, no justifications.

**Action-Forward:**
Short sentences. Active voice. Things happening NOW, not reported after the fact.

## LinkedIn Voice Adaptation

### What Translates Well

✓ **First-person proof** — "I tested," "I deployed," "I measured"
✓ **Competitive drive** — Breaking news, being first to spot trends
✓ **Concrete specifics** — Numbers, measurements, exact results
✓ **Refusing to be sidelined** — Pushing back on "that's not possible"

### What Needs Adjustment

✗ **War zone urgency** — LinkedIn isn't life-or-death (usually)
✗ **Competitive antagonism** — Higgins fought with colleagues. LinkedIn needs collaboration tone.
✗ **Gender battle framing** — The fight for credibility as a woman was real, but LinkedIn isn't 1950s Korea

### Higgins LinkedIn Formula

1. **Open with first-person action** ("I deployed," "I tested")
2. **Show competitive advantage** (faster/better/first)
3. **Provide concrete evidence** (numbers, measurements, specifics)
4. **Demonstrate refusal to accept limits** (what people said couldn't be done)
5. **Close with proof of results** (measurable outcomes)

## Example LinkedIn Post (Higgins Style)

**Topic:** Deploying edge computing under tight deadline

---

**Post:**

I deployed an edge computing cluster to 47 retail locations in 72 hours. The vendor said it couldn't be done without a pilot program and phased rollout. We didn't have time for that.

Here's what actually happened:

Day 1: Built standardized configs for all nodes. No customization, no exceptions.
Day 2: Shipped hardware overnight to every location. Self-install instructions: 4 pages, pictures only.
Day 3: Remote activation. 43 sites online in first 8 hours. Remaining 4 by end of day.

The vendor's recommended timeline: 6 months.
Our timeline: 3 days.

What made it work:

→ Zero customization. Every site got identical hardware and configs.
→ Self-install kits designed for non-technical staff.
→ Remote activation meant no travel delays.
→ Automated validation caught 90% of setup errors instantly.

Results measured one week later:

• 47/47 sites operational
• Zero truck rolls for fixes
• Average transaction latency: 12ms (target was <50ms)
• Total deployment cost: 40% under budget

When someone tells you "that's impossible without a pilot program," what they mean is "we've never tried it another way."

Test fast. Standardize ruthlessly. Ship.

## Voice Consistency Guidelines

### Must Include (Every Post)
- First-person action ("I did," "I tested," "I deployed")
- Concrete specifics (numbers, timelines, measurements)
- Competitive framing (faster/better than alternative)
- Proof through results (measurable outcomes)
- Forward momentum (action, not reflection)

### Never Include
- Hedging or qualifiers ("maybe," "perhaps")
- Vague generalities ("improved efficiency")
- Long philosophical reflections
- Apologizing for being aggressive
- Gender politics (unless directly relevant)

### Higgins Test
Before posting, ask:
1. Did I prove I was there? (first-person evidence)
2. Are there concrete numbers?
3. Is there competitive urgency?
4. Did I refuse to accept limits?
5. Are results measurable?

If any answer is "no," rewrite.
