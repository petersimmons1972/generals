## Symbol Usage

**Use em dash (—) not hyphen (-):**
- ✓ Correct: `—` (em dash, Alt+0151 on Windows, Option+Shift+- on Mac)
- ✗ Wrong: `-` (hyphen)
- ✗ Wrong: `--` (double hyphen)

**Why em dash:** Professional publishing standard for attribution breaks

## Why We Sign

### 1. Transparency
Readers deserve to know this is AI-generated content using a historical journalist's voice, not the actual person or a human pretending to be them.

### 2. Attribution
These journalists earned their reputations through courage, skill, and sacrifice. The signature honors their legacy while being honest about AI authorship.

### 3. Professional Ethics
War correspondents sign their work. Journalism requires accountability. AI-generated content should be clearly identified.

### 4. Historical Accuracy
- Ernie Pyle died at Ie Shima in 1945
- Martha Gellhorn died in 1998
- Walter Cronkite died in 2009
- Edward R. Murrow died in 1965
- Marguerite Higgins died in 1966
- George Orwell died in 1950

**These people are dead.** We honor them by being honest that this is AI.

### 5. Trust
The journalists we're emulating built careers on trust and honesty:
- Walter Cronkite was "the most trusted man in America" because he was honest
- Martha Gellhorn demanded truth-telling, not propaganda
- Ernie Pyle's authenticity came from genuine experience
- George Orwell wrote "Politics and the English Language" about clarity and honesty

**They would demand we be transparent about AI authorship.**

## Character Count Impact

**LinkedIn limit:** 1,500 characters
**Signature length:** ~45 characters (including em dash and line break)
**Content budget:** ~1,450 characters

**Example signature lengths:**
- "— Ernie Pyle, War Correspondent AI" = 40 chars
- "— Edward R. Murrow, War Correspondent AI" = 47 chars
- "— Martha Gellhorn, War Correspondent AI" = 46 chars
- "— Walter Cronkite, War Correspondent AI" = 46 chars
- "— Marguerite Higgins, War Correspondent AI" = 49 chars

**Always account for signature in character count.**

## Template Update

The `social/linkedin/TEMPLATE-DAY.md` template includes signature placeholder:

```markdown
[CALL TO ACTION - Question or engagement prompt]

—
[Journalist Name], War Correspondent AI

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5
```

**Never skip the signature.**

## Historical Note

All six journalists covered war as correspondents:
- Ernie Pyle: WWII Pacific and European theaters
- Edward R. Murrow: WWII London Blitz, later broadcast journalism
- Martha Gellhorn: Spanish Civil War, WWII, Vietnam, Central America
- Walter Cronkite: WWII (D-Day, Battle of the Bulge), Vietnam
- Marguerite Higgins: WWII, Korean War, Vietnam
- George Orwell: Spanish Civil War (fought and reported)

**"War Correspondent" is historically accurate for all of them.**
