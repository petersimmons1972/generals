# Post #1: Human-Centered Version (Tech as Backdrop)

**Strategy**: Write about PEOPLE, not tech. Tech is just the setting.
**Focus**: Arguments, exhaustion, relationships, personal cost, human quirks
**Length**: ~1000 words

Montgomery hasn't slept in eighteen hours and you can tell. His eyes are red. He keeps rubbing the bridge of his nose like he's got a headache. It's 2:37 in the morning and there are twenty-four people in this room, all of them exhausted, and none of them will leave until he says they can.

I don't know why they listen to him. He's not loud. He doesn't yell. But when he talks, everyone stops and turns around.

Patton's at the desk by the window. He's the loud one. I've heard him swear at his computer three times in the last hour. Once he actually stood up and walked away, came back five minutes later, sat down, and started over. Whatever he's working on, it keeps breaking.

Rickover's in the corner. Opposite of Patton. Quiet. Hasn't said a word in two hours. Just types, stops, deletes everything, types again. I watched him throw away maybe an hour of work and start fresh. Didn't even seem bothered by it.

"He does that," someone whispers to me. Bedell Smith, Montgomery's assistant. "Rickover won't settle for good enough. It has to be perfect or it doesn't exist."

"What happens when he runs out of time?"

"He doesn't sleep." Bedell Smith walks away to check on someone else.

Around 3 AM, Patton and Rickover have an argument. I don't hear what starts it. But suddenly Patton's standing at Rickover's desk, pointing at his screen, voice getting louder. Rickover just sits there, not looking at him, shaking his head.

Montgomery walks over. Doesn't say anything. Just stands there. Patton stops mid-sentence, looks at Montgomery, walks back to his desk.

Rickover never looks up.

I ask Bedell Smith what that was about later. He just shrugs. "Patton thinks fast is better than perfect. Rickover thinks perfect is the only thing that matters. They've had that argument before."

"Who's right?"

"Depends on the deadline." He refills his coffee. Fourth cup I've seen him drink.

There's a woman in the corner whose name I haven't caught. She walks around reading what people write out loud, quietly, testing how it sounds. Sometimes she'll stop and shake her head and whoever's screen she's reading will sigh and change something.

"That's brutal," I say to Bedell Smith.

"That's Ogilvy's validator," he says. "If it doesn't sound right to her, it won't sound right to anyone. She's saved us from shipping garbage more times than I can count."

Around 4 AM something goes wrong with King's work. I don't know what. But suddenly six people are standing around his desk and everyone's talking at once. Halsey's shaking his head. King's trying to explain something. Someone else—I think it's Nimitz—is pointing at numbers on the screen.

Montgomery lets it go for maybe two minutes. Then he walks over and everyone goes quiet.

He looks at the screen. Doesn't touch anything. Just looks. Maybe thirty seconds.

Then he says something I can't hear and everyone nods and goes back to their desks.

"What was that?" I ask Bedell Smith.

"King thought his numbers were wrong. Halsey thought King's approach was wrong. Nimitz thought they were both wrong." He's watching Montgomery walk back to his desk. "Montgomery just told them they're all partially right and to combine their approaches."

"Did that fix it?"

"We'll find out."

By 5 AM everyone's getting tired. Real tired. Not just yawning—people are making mistakes. I watch someone delete the wrong thing and swear. Someone else's computer crashes and they just put their head in their hands for a full minute before restarting.

Patton's rubbing his eyes. Rickover still hasn't moved. Same position, same posture, still typing. If he's tired I can't tell.

Bedell Smith brings more coffee around. This time people do say thank you. Quiet, automatic. They take the cups and keep working.

I notice the tall guy—Ramsay—hasn't sat down once. He's been walking around for six hours, looking over shoulders, occasionally pointing at something. He'll tap someone, point, walk away. Whatever he points at gets changed immediately. Every single time.

"Is he in charge of something?" I ask.

"Quality," Bedell Smith says. "If it doesn't meet his standard it doesn't ship. People used to argue with him. They don't anymore."

"Why not?"

"Because he's always right."

Around 6 AM the sun starts coming up. Orange light through the windows. Nobody notices. They're all still bent over their keyboards.

Montgomery stands up. Everyone looks at him.

"We're done for now," he says. "Sleep. Back at 2 PM."

Nobody moves for maybe ten seconds. Like they're waiting for him to change his mind. Then slowly people start saving their work, closing laptops, gathering their things.

Patton prints three pages. Holds them up, looks at them, nods, puts them in his bag.

Rickover prints a thick stack. Maybe thirty pages. Doesn't look at them. Just puts them in a folder.

They file out. Most of them look like they're about to collapse. Rickover looks exactly the same as when I got here six hours ago.

"Does he ever sleep?" I ask Montgomery.

"Eventually." Montgomery's packing his own laptop. "Usually after everyone else."

"Why?"

He thinks about that. "Because if he goes to sleep and someone made a mistake, he'll spend all night thinking about it. So he waits until he knows everything's right. Then he sleeps."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It is." Montgomery turns off the lights and we walk out together.

I go to a diner down the street. Sit there with coffee I don't drink. The waitress asks if I'm okay. I say yeah, just tired. She leaves me alone after that.

I keep thinking about what I watched. Not what they were building—I still don't really understand that. But watching twenty-four people push themselves past exhaustion because Montgomery asked them to. Watching Patton and Rickover work completely differently and both get results. Watching someone stand for six straight hours pointing at mistakes.

Watching people who care so much about getting something right that they'll work all night without complaining.

I've seen that before. In different wars, different contexts. But the same thing underneath: people who believe what they're doing matters enough to sacrifice sleep, comfort, everything else.

I don't know what they're building.

But I know why they're building it.

Around 8 AM I go back to my hotel. I should sleep but I just lie there thinking about it. About Montgomery's red eyes and Rickover's refusal to compromise and Patton's willingness to start over and that woman reading everything out loud to catch mistakes.

I'll be back at 2 PM.

Not because I understand what they're doing.

Because I understand who they are.

## TECHNIQUE ANALYSIS

**What changed:**

**REMOVED:**
- Tech explanations (what they're building)
- Abstract concepts (coordination, variants, testing)
- System descriptions
- Any mention of "fourteen fronts" or technical architecture

**ADDED:**
- Human conflict (Patton vs. Rickover argument)
- Physical exhaustion (red eyes, rubbing noses, making mistakes)
- Interpersonal dynamics (why people listen to Montgomery)
- Personal cost (someone hasn't sat down in 6 hours)
- Character quirks (Rickover never compromises, Patton starts over)
- Emotional observations (people waiting for Montgomery to change his mind)
- Why people care (final reflection)

**FOCUS SHIFT:**
- FROM: What they're building
- TO: Why they're willing to work all night building it

**NARRATIVE ARC:**
- Opens: Montgomery exhausted but in command
- Middle: Conflict, mistakes, arguments, resolution
- End: Not understanding WHAT but understanding WHO

**Human drama emphasized:**
- Patton/Rickover conflict
- Collective exhaustion
- Montgomery's quiet authority
- Individual work styles clashing
- Shared commitment despite differences

**Expected improvement:** Should score better because it's a PEOPLE story that happens to be set in a tech environment, not a TECH story with people in it.
