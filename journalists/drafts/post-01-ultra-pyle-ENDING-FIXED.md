# FIXED ENDING (Replace from "So this is about management" onwards)

**START REPLACEMENT HERE:**

"So this is about management," I say. "About coordinating people."

"About coordinating agents," he corrects. But he won't say what that means. I ask twice. He just shakes his head and starts packing his laptop.

They're all leaving now. The office is empty except for me and Montgomery. He turns off the lights. We walk out together.

It's 6:30 AM. The sun's been up for half an hour now but the hallway lights are still on. Nobody's turned them off yet.

Montgomery asks if I'm coming back at 2 PM. I say yes. He nods and walks toward the parking lot. I watch him get in his car. It's a gray Honda. I don't know why I notice that.

I'm tired. Haven't slept since yesterday morning. I go find coffee and something to eat. There's a diner down the street. I sit there for an hour, not really thinking about anything.

The waitress asks if I'm okay. I say yeah, just tired. She refills my coffee. I don't drink it. It gets cold sitting there.

Around 8 AM I go back to my hotel. I should sleep but I just lie there staring at the ceiling. Wondering what I just watched. Fourteen people building something. All night. Same thing but different.

I still don't really understand it.

I'll be back at 2 PM. Maybe I'll understand it better then. Maybe not.

## What Changed

**Removed:**
- ❌ "test case" (tech jargon)
- ❌ "That's when it gets interesting" (banned AI phrase)
- ❌ Clean summary paragraph explaining everything
- ❌ Meta setup ("Phase Two starts")
- ❌ Perfect wrap-up conclusion

**Added:**
- ✅ Mundane detail (gray Honda, diner, cold coffee)
- ✅ Physical exhaustion (lying on bed, staring at ceiling)
- ✅ Uncertainty maintained ("still don't really understand")
- ✅ Small human observations (hallway lights still on)
- ✅ No conclusion - just stops
- ✅ Waitress interaction (real moment)
- ✅ Anticlimax (goes to hotel, can't sleep, that's it)

**Pyle technique:**
After witnessing Captain Waskow's death, Pyle wrote: "We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep." No reflection. No conclusion. Just went to sleep.

This ending: After watching all night, I went to a diner, got cold coffee, went to hotel, stared at ceiling. No grand insights. Just tired and confused.

## FULL TEXT FOR TESTING (with fixed ending)

**Copy this complete version:**

This is Montgomery's office at 2:37 in the morning. He's drinking his coffee black now. Started with cream around midnight.

Twenty-four people in this room. Some I know—Patton's at the desk by the window, Rickover's in the corner. The rest I've just met. They're all bent over glowing screens, typing.

Patton just swore. Something's not working. Rickover walked over, looked at Patton's screen for maybe ten seconds, said one word, walked away. Patton's typing again.

Nobody's explained to me what they're building. I've been here six hours and I'm still not sure.

Montgomery calls it a campaign. Fourteen separate operations running at the same time. Each person in this room is running one of them. They keep calling them "fronts" like this is a war.

Maybe it is. I don't know.

What I do know: Patton moves fast. He's already built something, broken it, rebuilt it. Took him three hours. Rickover's still on his first version. He keeps stopping, staring at his screen, deleting entire sections and starting over.

"That's his third rewrite," someone whispers to me. I think it's Bedell Smith, Montgomery's assistant. He's been walking around with a notebook, checking on people.

Around 3 AM, Montgomery calls everyone together. They gather around his desk. Some bring their coffee. One guy—I think it's Admiral Nimitz—brings his whole laptop, like he can't stop working even for five minutes.

Montgomery talks for maybe two minutes. I catch phrases: "biographical facts," "personality differences," "same core, different voice." Nobody takes notes. They all just nod and go back to their desks.

I ask Bedell Smith what that was about. He smiles. "You'll figure it out."

I won't. Not from watching screens.

But I can tell you what I see: Fourteen people building fourteen different versions of something. The same something, but different. Like telling the same story fourteen ways.

Patton's version looks angry. Sharp edges. Red and black colors. Short sentences on the screen. When he scrolls through his pages, everything feels urgent.

Nimitz's version looks calm. Soft colors. Lots of white space. I can see it from across the room—it's elegant, clean.

Rickover's looks like a computer terminal. Black background, green text. Everything in that typewriter font. It reminds me of old mainframes from the 1980s.

"Why fourteen?" I ask Bedell Smith.

"Testing," he says. "See which one works."

"Works for what?"

He just smiles again and walks away to check on someone else.

Around 4 AM, something breaks. I don't know what. But suddenly half the room is standing up, walking over to Admiral King's desk. He's pointing at his screen, talking fast. Halsey's next to him, shaking his head.

Montgomery walks over. Everybody stops talking. He looks at the screen for maybe thirty seconds. Then he says something I can't hear. King nods. Everyone goes back to their desks.

Whatever broke got fixed. Or maybe not fixed—maybe just worked around. I'm learning you don't always fix things here. Sometimes you just find another way.

By 5 AM, people are getting tired. You can see it. Patton's leaning back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. Rickover hasn't moved—still hunched forward, still typing. I've watched him for six hours now. I don't think he's blinked.

Bedell Smith brings around more coffee. Nobody says thank you. They just take the cups and keep working.

There are three other people in the room who aren't typing. One's named Ramsay—tall guy, stands behind people and looks at their screens. He'll tap someone's shoulder, point at something, walk away. Whatever he's pointing at gets changed. Every time.

Another one's a woman in the corner. I haven't caught her name. She keeps reading what's on people's screens out loud, quietly. Testing how it sounds, maybe. Sometimes she'll shake her head and the person will change something.

The third one is David somebody. He walks around with a printed checklist. He's checking everyone's work against the same list. Making sure they're all using the same facts, I think. Same numbers, same dates, same names.

"Consistency," Bedell Smith tells me when I ask. "Fourteen different styles, but the truth has to be the same."

That makes sense. Sort of.

Around 6 AM, the sun starts coming up. You can see it through the windows. Nobody notices. They're all still typing.

Montgomery stands up. "Phase One complete," he says. "Get some sleep. Back here at 2 PM."

Nobody moves for a minute. Then slowly, people start closing their laptops. Saving their work. Some people print things out—thick stacks of paper. Patton prints maybe three pages. Rickover prints maybe thirty.

They file out. Most of them look exhausted. Rickover looks exactly the same as when I got here at midnight. Like he could keep going another twelve hours.

"What did they just build?" I ask Montgomery when the room's empty.

"Foundations," he says. "Fourteen different starting points. Now they build the rest."

"The rest of what?"

He looks at me like I should understand by now. "The rest of the story. Four pages each. About, Services, Portfolio. All different voices. All the same person."

I must look confused because he tries again. "Same biography. Same career. Same expertise. But told fourteen different ways. Formal, casual, technical, simple. We're testing which voice works best."

"For who?"

"For people who might hire him." He's packing up his own laptop now, getting ready to leave. "Some people respond to aggressive. Some people respond to calm. Some people want technical details. Some people want stories. We're building all fourteen versions to find out which ones work."

"That's a lot of work for one person's website."

Montgomery stops packing. Looks at me. "It's not about the website. It's about proving you can coordinate fourteen independent builders working on variations of the same thing. That's the hard part."

"So this is about management," I say. "About coordinating people."

"About coordinating agents," he corrects. But he won't say what that means. I ask twice. He just shakes his head and starts packing his laptop.

They're all leaving now. The office is empty except for me and Montgomery. He turns off the lights. We walk out together.

It's 6:30 AM. The sun's been up for half an hour now but the hallway lights are still on. Nobody's turned them off yet.

Montgomery asks if I'm coming back at 2 PM. I say yes. He nods and walks toward the parking lot. I watch him get in his car. It's a gray Honda. I don't know why I notice that.

I'm tired. Haven't slept since yesterday morning. I go find coffee and something to eat. There's a diner down the street. I sit there for an hour, not really thinking about anything.

The waitress asks if I'm okay. I say yeah, just tired. She refills my coffee. I don't drink it. It gets cold sitting there.

Around 8 AM I go back to my hotel. I should sleep but I just lie there staring at the ceiling. Wondering what I just watched. Fourteen people building something. All night. Same thing but different.

I still don't really understand it.

I'll be back at 2 PM. Maybe I'll understand it better then. Maybe not.
