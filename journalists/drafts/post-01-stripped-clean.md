Montgomery looks terrible. Red eyes, needs a shave, keeps rubbing his face. It's 2:37 in the morning. Twenty-four people in this room and half of them look like they want to quit.

Someone just made a mistake that cost three hours of work. I don't know who. Montgomery said "start over" and somebody swore under their breath and now they're rebuilding something.

Patton's at the window desk. Loud. Aggressive. Just got in an argument with someone—I think Halsey—about whether to redo something or ship it broken. Halsey said ship it, they'll fix it later. Patton said that's how you end up with garbage. They argued for maybe five minutes before Montgomery walked over and said something I couldn't hear.

Patton went back to his desk. Halsey didn't. Just stood there looking angry for another minute before sitting down.

Rickover's in the corner typing. He's been there for six hours. Hasn't moved. Bedell Smith—Montgomery's assistant—told me earlier that Rickover deleted four hours of work around midnight because it wasn't good enough.

"Four hours?" I said.

"He does that." Bedell Smith doesn't seem bothered by it. "Says if it's not right it's not real."

"That's insane."

"That's Rickover."

Around 3 AM, Patton and Rickover get in it. I don't hear the start but suddenly Patton's at Rickover's desk, voice raised, pointing at something. Rickover just shakes his head, doesn't look up, keeps typing.

"You're wasting time," Patton says. Loud enough I can hear across the room.

Rickover still doesn't look at him. "You're wasting effort."

"What does that mean?"

"It means fast and wrong is worse than slow and right."

Patton's face goes red. "We have a deadline."

"Then maybe you should stop bothering me and let me work."

Montgomery appears. Doesn't say anything. Just stands there between them. Patton stares at Rickover for another few seconds, then walks back to his desk.

Rickover never looked up once.

"Who won that?" I ask Bedell Smith later.

He shrugs. "Neither. They'll have the same argument tomorrow."

"Does it matter who's right?"

"Only if we miss the deadline." He's on his fifth cup of coffee. Or sixth. I've lost count.

Around 3:30 AM someone's computer crashes. Blue screen. Everything gone.

"Did you save it?" Montgomery asks.

Long pause. "Most of it."

"How much is most?"

"Maybe... two hours gone?"

You can feel the room tense up. Montgomery just nods. "Rebuild it. Everyone else, backup your work. Now."

People start frantically saving things. Someone mutters "should've done that an hour ago." Someone else says "we did."

Turns out five people haven't backed up their work all night. Montgomery makes them do it right then, in front of everyone.

There's a woman who walks around reading what people write. Out loud. Quietly, but out loud. Every time she shakes her head someone has to rewrite something.

She's been shaking her head a lot tonight.

"How many rewrites is that?" I ask Bedell Smith.

"For who?"

"For everyone."

He thinks about it. "Thirty? Forty? I stopped counting."

"Is that normal?"

"For this? Yeah. You don't ship garbage. You catch it before it ships."

Around 4 AM something goes wrong with King's work. Not sure what. But suddenly six people are around his desk and everyone's talking at once.

Halsey: "The numbers don't work."

King: "The numbers are fine, your assumptions are wrong."

Nimitz: "Both your numbers and your assumptions are wrong."

Someone else: "Can we just start over?"

King: "Absolutely not."

It's chaos. Everyone's talking over each other. Voices getting louder.

Montgomery lets it go for a while. Maybe three minutes. Then he walks over and everyone shuts up.

He looks at the screen. Touches nothing. Just looks.

Then: "King, your numbers are right but your approach is wrong. Halsey, your assumptions are wrong. Nimitz, show them what you mean."

Nimitz leans over, types something. King watches. Halsey watches.

"Oh," King says.

"Yeah," Nimitz says.

They go back to their desks. Problem's not solved, but at least they're not yelling anymore.

"Does Montgomery always know the answer?" I ask Bedell Smith.

"No. Sometimes he's just better at stopping fights."

By 5 AM everyone's exhausted and making mistakes. Real mistakes, not just small stuff. Someone deletes the wrong file. Someone else saves over something important. Someone's typing and halfway through a sentence just stops, stares at the screen, closes their eyes.

Patton's rubbing his face. Looking at his screen like it personally offended him.

Rickover's still typing. Same posture. Same rhythm. If he's tired I cannot tell.

Coffee's not helping anymore. Bedell Smith brings it around and people take it but nobody drinks it. Cups just sitting there getting cold.

The tall guy—Ramsay—is still walking around. Six hours straight. Looking over shoulders, pointing at things. He hasn't said more than five words all night but every time he points, people change what they're doing.

"What if they don't?" I ask Bedell Smith.

"Don't what?"

"Change it when he points."

"They do."

"But what if they didn't?"

He thinks about that. "I don't know. Never seen it happen."

Around 5:30 AM there's another argument. Don't know who started it. But two people are standing up, voices raised, and someone else is trying to mediate but making it worse.

Montgomery's across the room. Doesn't even look up. Just says "sit down" loud enough to carry.

They sit down.

Whatever they were arguing about doesn't get resolved. They just stop arguing and go back to work.

Around 6 AM the sun comes up. Nobody cares. Orange light through the windows and everyone's still hunched over keyboards making mistakes and fixing them and making new ones.

Montgomery stands up. "Done."

"We're not finished," someone says.

"Yes you are. Sleep. Back at 2 PM."

"But—"

"2 PM." Montgomery starts packing his laptop.

Slowly people save their work. Some print things out. Patton prints maybe three pages. Rickover prints a thick stack, doesn't look at it.

They shuffle out. Most looking like they could sleep standing up. Rickover looks the same as six hours ago.

"Does he feel tired?" I ask Montgomery.

"Probably. He just doesn't show it."

"Why?"

Montgomery shrugs. "Some people are built different."

We're the last ones in the office. Montgomery turns off the lights. We walk out.

I go back to my hotel. Try to sleep. Can't.

I'll be back at 2 PM.
