# Post #1: Conflict & Imperfection Version

**Strategy**: Add messiness throughout - arguments, mistakes, confusion, contradictions
**Focus**: Human imperfection, not clean narrative
**Technique**: Multiple conflicts, people being wrong, changing minds, frustration

Montgomery looks terrible. Red eyes, needs a shave, keeps rubbing his face. It's 2:37 in the morning. Twenty-four people in this room and half of them look like they want to quit.

Someone just made a mistake that cost three hours of work. I don't know who. But I heard Montgomery say "start over" and somebody swore under their breath and now they're rebuilding something.

Patton's at the window desk. Loud. Aggressive. Just got in an argument with someone—I think Halsey—about whether to redo something or ship it broken. Halsey said ship it, they'll fix it later. Patton said that's how you end up with garbage. They argued for maybe five minutes before Montgomery walked over and said something I couldn't hear.

Patton went back to his desk. Halsey didn't. Just stood there looking angry for another minute before sitting down.

Rickover's in the corner typing. He's been there for six hours. Hasn't moved. Someone—Bedell Smith, Montgomery's assistant—told me earlier that Rickover deleted four hours of work around midnight because it wasn't good enough.

"Four hours?" I said.

"He does that." Bedell Smith doesn't seem bothered by it. "Says if it's not right it's not real."

"That's insane."

"That's Rickover."

Around 3 AM, Patton and Rickover get in it. I don't hear the start but suddenly Patton's at Rickover's desk, voice raised, pointing at something. Rickover just shakes his head, doesn't look up, keeps typing.

"You're wasting time," Patton says. Loud enough I can hear across the room.

Rickover still doesn't look at him. "You're wasting effort."

"What does that mean?"

"It means fast and wrong is worse than slow and right."

Patton's face goes red. "We have a deadline."

"Then maybe you should stop bothering me and let me work."

Montgomery appears. Doesn't say anything. Just stands there between them. Patton stares at Rickover for another few seconds, then walks back to his desk.

Rickover never looked up once.

"Who won that?" I ask Bedell Smith later.

He shrugs. "Neither. They'll have the same argument tomorrow."

"Does it matter who's right?"

"Only if we miss the deadline." He's on his fifth cup of coffee. Or sixth. I've lost count.

Around 3:30 AM someone's computer crashes. Just... dies. Blue screen. Everything gone.

"Did you save it?" Montgomery asks.

Long pause. "Most of it."

"How much is most?"

"Maybe... two hours gone?"

You can feel the room tense up. Montgomery just nods. "Rebuild it. Everyone else, backup your work. Now."

People start frantically saving things. Someone mutters "should've done that an hour ago." Someone else says "we did."

Turns out five people haven't backed up their work all night. Montgomery makes them do it right then, in front of everyone. Like a punishment.

There's a woman who walks around reading what people write. Out loud. Quietly, but out loud. Every time she shakes her head someone has to rewrite something.

She's been shaking her head a lot tonight.

"How many rewrites is that?" I ask Bedell Smith.

"For who?"

"For everyone."

He thinks about it. "Thirty? Forty? I stopped counting."

"Is that normal?"

"For this? Yeah. You don't ship garbage. You catch it before it ships."

Around 4 AM something goes really wrong with King's work. Not sure what. But suddenly six people are around his desk and everyone's talking at once.

Halsey: "The numbers don't work."

King: "The numbers are fine, your assumptions are wrong."

Nimitz: "Both your numbers and your assumptions are wrong."

Someone else: "Can we just start over?"

King: "Absolutely not."

It's chaos. Everyone's talking over each other. Voices getting louder.

Montgomery lets it go for a while. Maybe three minutes. Then he walks over and everyone shuts up.

He looks at the screen. Touches nothing. Just looks.

Then: "King, your numbers are right but your approach is wrong. Halsey, your assumptions are wrong. Nimitz, show them what you mean."

Nimitz leans over, types something. King watches. Halsey watches.

"Oh," King says.

"Yeah," Nimitz says.

They go back to their desks. Problem's not solved, but at least they're not yelling anymore.

"Does Montgomery always know the answer?" I ask Bedell Smith.

"No. Sometimes he's just better at stopping fights."

By 5 AM everyone's exhausted and making mistakes. Real mistakes, not just small stuff. I watch someone delete the wrong file. Someone else saves over something important. Someone's typing and halfway through a sentence just stops, stares at the screen, closes their eyes.

Patton's rubbing his face. Looking at his screen like it personally offended him.

Rickover's still typing. Same posture. Same rhythm. If he's tired I cannot tell.

Coffee's not helping anymore. Bedell Smith brings it around and people take it but nobody drinks it. Cups just sitting there getting cold.

The tall guy—Ramsay—is still walking around. Six hours straight. Looking over shoulders, pointing at things. He hasn't said more than five words all night but every time he points, people change what they're doing.

"What if they don't?" I ask Bedell Smith.

"Don't what?"

"Change it when he points."

"They do."

"But what if they didn't?"

He thinks about that. "I don't know. Never seen it happen."

Around 5:30 AM there's another argument. Don't know who started it. But two people are standing up, voices raised, and someone else is trying to mediate but making it worse.

Montgomery's across the room. Doesn't even look up. Just says "sit down" loud enough to carry.

They sit down.

Whatever they were arguing about doesn't get resolved. They just stop arguing and go back to work.

Around 6 AM the sun comes up. Nobody cares. Orange light through the windows and everyone's still hunched over keyboards making mistakes and fixing them and making new ones.

Montgomery stands up. "Done."

"We're not finished," someone says.

"Yes you are. Sleep. Back at 2 PM."

"But—"

"2 PM." Montgomery starts packing his laptop.

Slowly people save their work. Some print things out. Patton prints maybe three pages. Rickover prints a thick stack, doesn't look at it.

They shuffle out. Most looking like they could sleep standing up. Rickover looks the same as six hours ago.

"Does he feel tired?" I ask Montgomery.

"Probably. He just doesn't show it."

"Why?"

Montgomery shrugs. "Some people are built different."

We're the last ones in the office. Montgomery turns off the lights. We walk out.

"Think they'll come back?" I ask.

"At 2 PM? Yeah."

"Even after tonight?"

"Especially after tonight." He gets in his car—gray Honda, I notice for no reason—and drives off.

I sit in a diner for an hour. Waitress asks if I need anything. I say no. She refills my coffee anyway. It goes cold.

I'm thinking about what I watched. Arguments that didn't get resolved. Mistakes that cost hours. People working past exhaustion not because they want to but because Montgomery expects it.

Patton and Rickover still disagree about everything. The person who lost two hours of work to a computer crash still has to rebuild it. Whatever King and Halsey were arguing about probably isn't fixed, just postponed.

Nothing's finished. Nothing's resolved. They're just... stopping for now.

I don't understand what they're building. I don't understand why they're willing to fight each other about it at 3 AM. I don't understand why losing four hours of work is acceptable to Rickover.

Maybe I'll understand tomorrow. Maybe not.

Around 8 AM I'm back at my hotel. Can't sleep. Just thinking about twenty-four people who care enough about something to argue and make mistakes and start over and keep going.

I've seen that before. Different contexts, different wars. But something similar underneath.

Not sure what.

I'll be back at 2 PM.

## TECHNIQUE NOTES

**Added throughout:**

**Conflicts (multiple):**
- Patton vs. Rickover (unresolved)
- Patton vs. Halsey (ship broken vs. redo)
- King vs. Halsey vs. Nimitz (numbers argument)
- Random argument at 5:30 AM (doesn't get resolved)

**Mistakes:**
- Someone lost 3 hours of work
- Computer crash (2 hours lost)
- Five people forgot to back up
- Someone deletes wrong file
- Someone saves over something important
- People making typos from exhaustion

**Imperfection:**
- Arguments don't get resolved, just stopped
- Problems don't get fixed, just postponed
- People are wrong and stay wrong
- Coffee doesn't help anymore
- Nothing's finished, just paused

**Human messiness:**
- Contradictions (is coffee his fifth or sixth?)
- Uncertainty (don't know who made initial mistake)
- Incomplete information (didn't hear what Montgomery said)
- Emotional exhaustion (people staring at screens)
- Physical breakdown (can't focus, typos, mistakes)

**No clean conclusions:**
- "Maybe I'll understand tomorrow. Maybe not."
- "Not sure what."
- Ending admits confusion, no insight
- Nothing wrapped up neatly

**Expected improvement:** More human conflict + imperfection + unresolved tensions should read as more authentic human experience, less AI narrative polish.
