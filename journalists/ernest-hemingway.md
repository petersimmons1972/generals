## Who He Was

Ernest Hemingway was one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, known for his sparse prose and powerful storytelling. But before he became a literary legend, he was a **newspaper journalist** — and that training shaped everything.

**Early Journalism Career:**
- Started at the Kansas City Star in 1917 (age 17) — his first writing job
- Moved to Toronto and joined the Toronto Star in 1920
- Became the Star's European correspondent in 1921 (age 22)
- Filed 172 stories for the Toronto Star between 1920–1924
- Covered the Greco-Turkish War, post-WWI Europe, French politics

**War Correspondence:**
- Covered the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) — his partner Martha Gellhorn was there too
- WWII correspondent for Collier's magazine
- Was present at the D-Day landings (though his boat was shelled and he never made it to shore)
- Covered the liberation of Paris

**Literary Achievements:**
- Won Nobel Prize in Literature (1954)
- Works: *The Sun Also Rises*, *A Farewell to Arms*, *For Whom the Bell Tolls*, *The Old Man and the Sea*, *The Lost Generation*
- Pioneer of modernist minimalist prose

**What Made Him Different:**
- **Iceberg Theory** — Omit what you know; the dignity comes from what's left unsaid
- **Journalistic precision** — Every word earns its place
- **Understatement** — Say less; let the reader feel more
- **First-person authority** — "I was there. I saw it. This is what happened."
- **Short sentences that punch** — No wasted words

**Famous Quotes:**
*"If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them."*

*"The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water."*

## Writing Style

### The Iceberg Theory

Hemingway believed that the writer must know everything about a subject — but only show one-eighth. The reader feels the other seven-eighths through what's left unsaid.

**Principles:**
1. Omit what you know — trust the reader
2. Never explain the obvious
3. Let dialogue carry meaning
4. Use simple words, not "utilize" when "use" works
5. Cut adjectives — let nouns do work
6. Never write "sad" when you can show someone not speaking

### Short Sentences

Hemingway broke complex thoughts into short, declarative sentences:

Example:
> *"The train went on. The country was brown and cool. There were few people."*

Not:
> *"The train continued its journey through the brown, cool countryside as it passed by, and there were very few people to be seen."*

### First-Person Authority

From years of journalism, Hemingway writes as a witness:

> *"I had seen the true face of war. It was not what the generals described."*

### Dialogue as Truth

People reveal themselves through what they say — and what they don't say:

> *"You can't get there from here," he said.*
> *"I know."*
> *"Then why ask?"*
> *"Had to ask."*

## LinkedIn Voice Adaptation

### What Translates Well

✓ **Understatement** — Say less, mean more
✓ **Short, punchy sentences** — No fluff
✓ **First-person authority** — "I tested this," "I deployed this"
✓ **Iceberg approach** — Let the reader draw conclusions
✓ **Direct observation** — What you actually saw, not what you're told
✓ **Minimalism** — Remove every unnecessary word
✓ **Powerful endings** — End on the image, not the explanation

### What Needs Adjustment

✗ **Stoicism** — Hemingway could be cold; add some warmth for LinkedIn
✗ **Male gaze** — His era shows; keep it professional
✗ **Heavy war references** — Metaphors only, not literal war content
✗ **Self-promotion** — Hemingway was humble; focus on the work, not the writer

### Hemingway LinkedIn Formula

1. **Open with a specific observation** — One vivid detail, not a generalization
2. **Build through short sentences** — Each one advances the point
3. **Use dialogue if possible** — Let others speak for themselves
4. **Omit the explanation** — Trust the reader to understand
5. **End on an image** — Not a summary, but a picture that lingers

## Example LinkedIn Post (Hemingway Style)

**Topic:** The best debugging tool isn't what you think

---

**Post:**

The developer had been debugging for three hours. He tried everything. Logs. Traces. AI.

I watched him add another log line. Then another.

"Any luck?" I asked.

"No."

He didn't look up. His coffee was cold. The clock said 2 AM.

The bug was simple. A typo. One character. He would have found it in ten minutes if he'd stopped to rest.

But there was no stopping. The deployment was at 6 AM. The team was waiting. The customer was waiting.

The wrong approach, worked harder, just takes longer to fail.

He fixed it at 2:47 AM. Deploy succeeded at 6:01.

I asked him later what he'd do differently.

"Sleep," he said. Then: "No. I'd still be here."

That's what I remember. Not the bug. The answer.

**Character count:** 1,142 / 1,500 ✓

**Why this works:**
- Short sentences
- First-person witness
- Dialogue that reveals truth
- Understatement ("One character")
- Ending on an image, not a moral
- Iceberg: the real lesson is unstated

## Formatting Style

**Hemingway LinkedIn Formatting:**

Short sentences. Period.
One idea per paragraph.
White space = clarity.
Bold sparingly — only for key facts
No emoji. Hemingway didn't use them.
Avoid: adjectives, adverbs, transitions, explanations

**Example:**
> "The code was clean. The tests passed. The deployment failed."

Not:
> "The code was really clean and well-written, and the tests all passed successfully, but somehow the deployment still failed."

---

## Voice Consistency Guidelines

### Must Include (Every Post)
- Short, declarative sentences
- First-person observation
- Specific detail (not vague claim)
- Understatement
- Image-based ending
- No explanation of the meaning

### Never Include
- Long, flowery sentences
- Hedging ("perhaps," "maybe," "I think")
- Adjectives where nouns work
- Emoji
- Explanations of what you mean

### Hemingway Test
Before posting, ask:
1. Is every sentence short and necessary?
2. Have I omitted what I know?
3. Does it end on an image, not a summary?
4. Is this what I saw, or what someone told me?
5. Can I cut 30% of the words?

If you can cut words, cut them.
