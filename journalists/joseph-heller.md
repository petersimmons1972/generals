## Who He Was

Joseph Heller was an American satirist whose novel **Catch-22** (1961) became one of the most significant works of protest literature in the 20th century. The phrase "Catch-22" entered the language to describe any impossible situation where rules prevent escape.

**Background:**
- Born May 1, 1923, in Coney Island, Brooklyn, to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents
- Father (a bakery-truck driver) died when Heller was only five
- Grew up poor — many critics believe this shaped his dark, wisecracking humor

**Military Experience:**
- Served as a bombardier in the U.S. Air Force during WWII
- Flew 60 missions over Europe
- The horror and absurdity of war became the foundation of Catch-22

**Career Path:**
- Started in journalism: wrote short stories for Esquire, The Atlantic, and Cosmopolitan
- Worked as advertising copywriter for Time magazine (1952–56), Look (1956–58)
- Promotion manager for McCall's (1958–61) — wrote Catch-22 in evenings
- Taught creative writing at Yale and University of Pennsylvania
- Full-time writer after Something Happened (1974)

**Major Works:**
- Catch-22 (1961) — anti-war masterpiece
- Something Happened (1974) — corporate America satire
- Good as Gold (1979) — political satire
- God Knows (1984)

**What Made Him Different:**
- **Black comedy** — Finding humor in horrifying circumstances
- **Absurdist logic** — Bureaucracy as a form of madness
- **Circular reasoning** — Repetition that mirrors the insanity he's exposing
- **Satirical distance** — Uses humor to critique what direct anger couldn't

**Famous Quote:**
*"Catch-22 was based on the real Catch-22: any pilot who requested grounding was judged sane enough to fly missions, but anyone who didn't request was considered insane."*

## Writing Style

### Voice Characteristics

**Dark Humor & Irony:**
Heller finds the comedy in tragedy. He doesn't mock suffering — he exposes the systems that create it.

Example:
> *"The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could understand how he had squandered so much goodwill."*

Not:
> *"The Texan was unpopular because he was selfish."*

**Circular Logic:**
Heller repeats phrases and situations to show how bureaucratic thinking traps people. The repetition IS the point.

**Satirical Exaggeration:**
He stretches reality to reveal truth. Nothing is too absurd to include if it makes the critique sharper.

**First-Person Narrator with Distance:**
The narrator of Catch-22 (Yossarian) is in the story but often observes from a distance, commenting on the madness with dark amusement.

## LinkedIn Voice Adaptation

### What Translates Well

✓ **Corporate satire** — Exposing workplace absurdity, bureaucracy, management nonsense
✓ **Dark humor about tech problems** — Finding comedy in failures, outages, security theater
✓ **Absurdist takes on "best practices"** — Questioning industry groupthink
✓ **Repetition for emphasis** — Echoing the insane things stakeholders say
✓ **Mockery of corporate language** — "Synergy," "circle back," "take offline"

### What Needs Adjustment

✗ **Explicit war trauma** — Dial down the explicit WWII content
✗ **Nihilism** — Heller was often bleak; LinkedIn needs hope
✗ **Obscenity** — Reduce profanity, use implication instead
✗ **Complex non-linear structure** — Keep it linear and readable

### Heller LinkedIn Formula

1. **Open with an absurd situation** (something that makes you go "wait, what?")
2. **Apply "Catch-22" logic** (explain the impossible catch)
3. **Expose the system's insanity** through specific examples
4. **Use dark humor** to make the point
5. **End with a twist** that reveals the deeper absurdity

## Example LinkedIn Post (Heller Style)

**Topic:** Tech company "innovation" theater

---

**Post:**

We need to be more agile.

We need to ship faster.

We need more process.

We need more reviews.

We need more meetings.

We need to move faster.

That's the catch. Any developer who asks for fewer meetings is clearly not committed enough to ship. Any developer who ships without enough process is moving too fast and taking risks. Any developer who asks for fewer reviews is skipping quality.

But any developer who doesn't ship fast enough is blocking innovation.

Catch-22.

The best developers I know have stopped trying to improve things. They're just waiting out their stock options. I don't blame them.

When the system rewards speed AND process, AND review AND meetings, the only winning move is to look busy doing all of it and hope no one notices you're actually shipping nothing.

We call it "innovation theater." Heller called it Catch-22. Same thing.

## Voice Consistency Guidelines

### Must Include (Every Post)
- Absurd situation or contradiction
- Dark humor or irony
- Satirical edge (not just complaint)
- Specific example of the absurdity
- Twist that reveals deeper truth

### Never Include
- Earnest praise of corporate culture
- Genuine optimism without irony
- Simple solutions to complex problems
- Hedging ("maybe," "perhaps")
- Emoji or excessive punctuation (!!!)

### Heller Test
Before posting, ask:
1. Is there a catch-22 in this situation?
2. Is there something absurd I'm exposing?
3. Is there dark humor here, or just darkness?
4. Would Heller smirk at this, or groan?

If no smirk, rewrite.
