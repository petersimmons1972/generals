## Decision Matrix by Content Type

### 1. Vendor Overpromise Exposé

**Scenario**: Security vendor claims 99% detection, reality is 40%

**Best Match**: **Gellhorn (88% fit)**
- Sharp opening: "I watched a CISO deploy..."
- First-person evidence: "What I saw..."
- Cuts through BS: Direct contradiction of claims
- Moral clarity: Why it matters beyond profit

**Runner-Up**: **Orwell (82% fit)**
- Concrete → Abstract: Deployment observation → Systemic critique
- Self-incriminating honesty: "I am not a software engineer. I will comment anyway."
- Numbered taxonomy: "Three patterns I observed..."
- Collective guilt: "What we were promised vs. what we deployed"

**Why Not Cronkite?** (65% fit)
- Too measured, not sharp enough
- Institutional voice avoids direct BS-calling
- Better for analysis after the fact, not frontline exposure

**Rationale**: Gellhorn's BS-cutting beats Orwell's systemic critique for **specific** vendor claims. Orwell better for **patterns across vendors**.

---

### 2. Rapid Deployment War Story

**Scenario**: Deployed edge computing to 47 sites in 72 hours when vendor said 6 months impossible

**Best Match**: **Higgins (95% fit)**
- Competitive framing: "Vendor said impossible..."
- First-person proof: "I deployed..."
- Concrete measurements: 47 sites, 72 hours, 12ms latency
- Action-forward urgency: Short sentences, active voice
- Refusing limits: "They said women can't cover combat / They said it can't be done without pilot"

**Runner-Up**: **Pyle (75% fit)**
- Ground-level observation: Physical details of deployment
- Human-centered: Engineers' exhaustion, relief when it worked
- Accessible: Beginners understand the story
- **But**: Less competitive urgency, more collaborative tone

**Why Not Murrow?** (45% fit)
- Too elevated, not ground-level enough
- Formal analysis misses competitive energy
- Better for "what this deployment means" not "how we did it"

**Rationale**: Higgins' competitive drive + concrete proof = perfect for "impossible deadline" stories.

---

### 3. Ground-Level Technical Storytelling

**Scenario**: How Rickover built zero-defect validator, observable human details

**Best Match**: **Pyle (93% fit)**
- Worm's eye view: From Rickover's perspective, not system architect
- Physical details: Coffee cups, line numbers, exact quotes
- Accessible clarity: Grade 8-9, zero jargon
- Human-centered: Personality + technical insight
- Meticulous simplicity: Complex made understandable

**Runner-Up**: **Higgins (70% fit)**
- First-person observation: "I watched Rickover..."
- Concrete specifics: Line counts, measurements
- **But**: Too competitive for collaborative technical work
- **But**: Cleaner prose lacks Pyle's messy humanity

**Why Not Orwell?** (55% fit)
- Would critique the need for zero-defect (systemic analysis)
- Self-incriminating honesty shifts focus from subject to writer
- Numbered taxonomies impose structure where story should flow

**Rationale**: Pyle's human connection + accessible clarity beats Higgins' competitive edge for daily technical storytelling.

---

### 4. Systems Critique / Ethical Analysis

**Scenario**: Multi-agent AI promised autonomy but requires constant human supervision

**Best Match**: **Orwell (98% fit)**
- Concrete → Abstract: Coffee cups, exhausted engineers → work transformation
- Self-incriminating honesty: "I am not a software engineer"
- Numbered taxonomy: "Four types of human intervention..."
- Collective guilt: "Systems we were promised vs. reality"
- Devastating close: "I doubt it" + return to concrete

**Runner-Up**: **Murrow (88% fit)**
- Elevated analysis: What supervision requirements mean strategically
- Formal authority: Grade 11-12 vocabulary
- Unresolved questions: "The question is not whether agents work, but what kind of work they create"
- **But**: Less concrete anchoring, more abstract

**Why Not Gellhorn?** (70% fit)**
- Sharp BS-cutting works for specific vendors
- Less effective for systemic patterns across industry
- Better at exposing lies than diagnosing structural problems

**Rationale**: Orwell's concrete → abstract escalation + numbered taxonomies = perfect for systemic critique.

---

### 5. Formal Thought Leadership

**Scenario**: Weekly analysis of AI coordination trends, elevated perspective

**Best Match**: **Murrow (92% fit)**
- Geographic grounding: "This is from..."
- Formal authority: Grade 11-12, intellectual respect
- Architectural logic: Complete thoughts, logical progression
- Strategic questions: Raises deeper issues
- Zero one-sentence paragraphs: Professional formality

**Runner-Up**: **Cronkite (88% fit)**
- Measured authority: Calm, credible analysis
- Institutional voice: Represents best practices
- Declarative clarity: "Here's what this means"
- **But**: More reactive (event commentary) than proactive (thought leadership)

**Why Not Orwell?** (72% fit)**
- Systemic critique feels negative for thought leadership
- Self-incriminating honesty undercuts authority
- Better for exposing problems than setting direction

**Rationale**: Murrow's formal witness authority + elevated perspective beats Cronkite's measured commentary for proactive thought leadership.

---

### 6. Crisis Communication

**Scenario**: Major security breach, need calm authoritative response

**Best Match**: **Cronkite (95% fit)**
- Calm opening: No panic, just facts
- Measured analysis: What happened, what it means
- Professional distance: Emotions under control
- Institutional credibility: Voice of reason
- Declarative close: "And that's where we stand"

**Runner-Up**: **Murrow (82% fit)**
- Formal authority: Broadcast gravitas
- Complete thoughts: Logical progression
- **But**: Raises unresolved questions (not reassuring in crisis)
- **But**: "There are no words" = admits defeat (wrong message)

**Why Not Gellhorn?** (45% fit)**
- Too sharp, too angry for crisis calm
- BS-cutting feels like blame assignment
- Better for exposing how crisis happened, not managing through it

**Rationale**: Cronkite's "most trusted man in America" authority + calm delivery beats Murrow's formal analysis for crisis management.

---

### 7. Trusted Industry Commentary

**Scenario**: Regular analysis of cybersecurity trends for executive audience

**Best Match**: **Cronkite (90% fit)**
- Earned authority: Experience, not hype
- Measured delivery: No sensationalism
- Pattern recognition: "This marks the fourth incident this year..."
- Professional tone: CBS Evening News credibility
- Builds trust: Never oversells, always delivers

**Runner-Up**: **Murrow (78% fit)**
- Broadcast excellence: Professional polish
- Intellectual respect: Grade 11-12 audience
- **But**: More formal/elevated than executives need
- **But**: Strategic questions > practical insights

**Why Not Pyle?** (60% fit)**
- Too ground-level for executive strategic view
- Conversational tone lacks institutional weight
- Better for practitioner audience than C-suite

**Rationale**: Cronkite's institutional credibility + measured analysis beats Murrow's elevated formality for regular executive commentary.

---

### DO NOT Use Murrow For:

❌ **Daily quick updates** - Too formal, too elevated
❌ **Casual behind-the-scenes** - Architectural logic kills spontaneity
❌ **Humor or lightness** - Broadcast gravitas too serious

## Voice Stacking: Using Multiple Journalists

### When to Deploy Two Voices for One Topic

**Scenario**: Major security breach requiring both analysis and systems critique

**Approach**:
1. **Cronkite** - Immediate calm analysis (Day 1)
   - "Here's what we know..."
   - Facts, timeline, impact
   - Measured response

2. **Orwell** - Systems critique (Day 3)
   - "This is the fourth breach this year involving..."
   - Numbered taxonomy of systemic failures
   - "What we were promised vs. what we deployed"

**Why This Works**: Cronkite establishes trust through calm facts. Orwell builds on that trust to diagnose systemic problems.

---

### The Three-Voice Campaign

**Scenario**: Major feature deployment across 6-9 weeks

**Approach**:
1. **Pyle** - Daily ground-level updates
   - Individual agent stories
   - Engineer experiences
   - Accessible technical details

2. **Murrow** - Weekly strategic analysis
   - What this deployment means
   - Elevated perspective
   - Unresolved questions

3. **Orwell** - Monthly systems critique
   - Gaps between promises and reality
   - Collective implications
   - Numbered taxonomy of learnings

**Why This Works**: Pyle = daily tactical, Murrow = weekly strategic, Orwell = monthly systemic.
