## Notes on Commander Selection

**When selecting commanders:**
1. Check personality fit (aggressive vs. methodical)
2. Review domain expertise (technical, strategic, operational)
3. Consider known rivalries (Bradley/Patton, etc.)
4. Check propaganda concerns (Axis commanders require extra scrutiny)
5. Use `/generals:match-commander-to-task` for recommendations

**Propaganda Risk Commanders** (require modern scholarship verification):
- Axis commanders (Clean Wehrmacht myth, self-mythology)
- MacArthur (extreme self-mythology)
- Patton (real-time self-promotion)
- Any commander with memoir (Tier 6 source = low reliability)

**Clean Test Cases** (minimal propaganda):
- Spruance (analytical, quiet)
- Portal (institutional role)
- Rickover (bureaucratic record)
- Dowding (focused mission, pushed out by politics)
