## Cross-Deployment Observations

### Existing Commanders (Performance in New Contexts)

**Admiral Nimitz**
- Previous: K8s manifests (organizational structure)
- This deployment: Competitive pricing research
- **Observation**: Collaborative style translated well - used multiple data sources, systematic approach
- **Consistency**: High-trust model evident in delegating to SearXNG without fallback

**Admiral Halsey**
- Previous: IngressRoutes (aggressive routing)
- This deployment: Vendor lock-in analysis
- **Observation**: "Hit them where they ain't" personality matched perfectly - exposed hidden lock-in traps
- **Consistency**: Aggressive pursuit of competitive intelligence

**Admiral Spruance**
- Previous: Verification/testing (methodical checklists)
- This deployment: Cost visualization design
- **Observation**: Analytical approach applied to financial charts - precise, calculated
- **Consistency**: Numbers-focused, methodical execution

**Admiral King**
- Previous: Deployment operations (perfectionist standards)
- This deployment: Multi-dimensional radar chart
- **Observation**: Perfectionism evident in precise axis scoring, clean polygon overlays
- **Consistency**: Demanding excellence in visualization quality

### Learning Accumulation Evidence

**Question**: Do commanders develop transferable skills across deployments?

**Early Evidence**:
- Nimitz's organizational excellence applied to both K8s structures AND research coordination
- King's perfectionism translated from deployment troubleshooting to visualization precision
- Spruance's analytical mindset worked for testing AND financial modeling
- Halsey's aggressive style matched both routing AND competitive analysis

**Hypothesis**: Personality traits ARE transferable, but task-specific expertise requires repetition

## Next Steps

1. **Profile Updates**: Update existing commander profiles with this deployment experience
2. **New Profiles**: Create profiles for Eisenhower, MacArthur, Bradley, Rommel, Zhukov, Montgomery
3. **Pattern Documentation**: Document "intelligence-driven visualization" pattern
4. **Specialization Tracking**: Track how many deployments needed before declaring specialization
