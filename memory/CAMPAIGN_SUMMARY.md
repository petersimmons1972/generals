## Active Patterns (What's Working)

✓ **Multi-commander campaigns** — 10-commander coordination works with phased deployment
✓ **Chart generation** — Inline SVG with namespaced IDs prevents conflicts
✓ **Service records** — Structured documentation improves cross-session learning
✓ **Personality consistency** — Commanders behave according to historical traits
✓ **Quality gates** — Gordon Ramsay validation catches presentation errors

---

## Failed Approaches (What to Avoid)

✗ **Gartner URL scraping** — Returns 403 errors, use Wayback Machine instead
✗ **Anonymous agent spawns** — Generic agents lose personality and lessons
✗ **Single-stage verification** — Code completion ≠ working output, verify end-to-end
✗ **Skipping service records** — Losing operational knowledge = repeating mistakes
✗ **Context bloat** — Loading all deployment logs kills performance

## Officer Deployment Stats (Last 30 Days)

| Commander | Deployments | Last Used | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Montgomery | 5 | 2026-02-07 | ⭐ Fatigued (6+) |
| Nimitz | 3 | 2026-02-07 | ⭐⭐ Available |
| Spruance | 2 | 2026-02-07 | ⭐⭐⭐ Rested |
| King | 2 | 2026-02-07 | ⭐⭐⭐ Rested |
| Zhukov | 1 | 2026-02-07 | ⭐⭐⭐ Rested |
| Rickover | 1 | 2026-02-08 | ⭐⭐⭐ Rested |
| Hopper | 1 | 2026-02-08 | ⭐⭐⭐ Rested |
| Patton | 0 | Never | ⭐⭐⭐ Rested |
| Halsey | 0 | Never | ⭐⭐⭐ Rested |
| MacArthur | 0 | Never | ⭐⭐⭐ Rested |

**Rotation Recommendation:** Consider Patton, Halsey, MacArthur, Bradley, Marshall for next missions

## Critical Lessons (Top 10)

1. **Multi-stage verification is mandatory** — Verify generation → integration → output for all pipelines
2. **Service records = self-learning** — Skipping records = zero knowledge retention
3. **Personality matters** — Patton ≠ Spruance, match temperament to task
4. **Context management** — Load CAMPAIGN_SUMMARY only, officer-knowledge on-demand
5. **Sanitization protocol** — Strip IPs, hostnames, URLs before GitHub commits
6. **Importance detection** — Parse user language for urgency (critical/frustrated = best generals)
7. **Stubborn problems = multi-approach** — Deploy different personalities to same problem
8. **Journalist continuity** — Same journalist covers entire campaign, voice evolves
9. **Illustration verification** — Check typos, data accuracy, accessibility before delivery
10. **Quality gates work** — Gordon Ramsay catches errors humans miss
