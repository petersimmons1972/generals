## Source Reliability Assessment

### RED FLAG Sources (Unreliable Without Cross-Reference)

- **Guderian, Heinz.** *Panzer Leader* (1952) -- Self-serving memoir
  - Contains "egregious untruths, half truths, and omissions" (Smelser & Davies)
  - "Took personal credit for all victories, denied responsibility for all defeats" (Hart)
  - Commissar Order denial directly contradicted by his own wartime reports
  - Published when German records were lost; no sources to challenge narrative
  - Written as implicit legal defense against war crimes prosecution

- **Guderian, Heinz.** *Achtung -- Panzer!* (1937) -- Advocacy document
  - Written at Lutz's request with deliberately polemical tone
  - Valuable as primary source for understanding interwar advocacy
  - Not reliable as objective military analysis

- **Liddell Hart interviews** -- Mutual mythologization
  - Hart asked German generals to credit him as influence; they obliged
  - "No contemporary, pre-war documentation" supports their assertions
  - Both parties benefited from inflating their connections

### RELIABLE Sources (Cross-Referenced, Post-Declassification)

- Hart (2006) -- Based on German archives, cross-referenced with primary records
- Smelser & Davies (2008) -- Cambridge University Press, peer-reviewed
- Battistelli -- Uses Wehrmacht records, cross-references memoir claims
- Wehrmacht operational records -- Primary documents
- Nuremberg/interrogation records -- Contemporary documentation
