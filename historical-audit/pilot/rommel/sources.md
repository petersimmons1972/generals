## Sources Deliberately Excluded (Pre-1990 / Propagandistic)

The following sources were identified and excluded as primary references due to propaganda risk:

- **B.H. Liddell Hart (ed.)**, *The Rommel Papers* (1953) -- Post-war rehabilitation document; Liddell Hart's editorial framing constructs mythology
- **Desmond Young**, *Rommel: The Desert Fox* (1950) -- Pre-critical biography, foundation of popular myth
- **David Irving**, various publications -- Discredited historian
- **Rommel's own writings** -- Valuable as primary sources of Rommel's self-presentation, but not reliable as historical evidence for claims made about his conduct

## Source Assessment Notes

**Strongest sources for propaganda detection:** Citino (2007), Bernhard, IWM documentation, Showalter (2006)
**Strongest sources for ethical assessment:** USHMM, Mallmann/Cuppers, Bernhard, Wette (2011)
**Most contested area:** July 20 plot involvement (Hoffmann vs. Beckett vs. Reuth vs. Evans)
**Most reliable statistics:** France 1940 prisoner counts (multiple independent confirmations)
**Least reliable area:** Distance claims in North Africa (need divisional records for precision)

*Sources organized according to Operation Historical Audit methodology: post-2000 academic sources prioritized, pre-1990 popular sources excluded unless primary documents, all disputed claims require 3+ modern sources.*
