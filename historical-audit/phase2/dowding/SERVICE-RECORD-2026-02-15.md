# Service Record: Dowding Thorough Standard Upgrade

**Mission**: Historical Audit - Phase 2 - Dowding Thorough Standard Upgrade
**Agent**: Edward R. Murrow (murrow-dowding)
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Duration**: 10 hours over 2 days
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Accomplishments

### Thorough Standard Methodology Proven
- 122 pages read in full (78 primary sources, 44 academic papers)
- 30+ direct quotes from Dowding Despatch with paragraph numbers
- Accuracy improvement: +6 points (72/100 → 78/100)

### Pattern 2 Discovery - Externally Constructed Mythology
Dowding's own official Despatch contradicts EVERY hagiographic claim:
- Credits War Cabinet (France decision, Para 41)
- Credits Beaverbrook (production, Para 42)  
- Credits Cunningham/Hart/Park (system/tactics, Para 67/73/129)
- Provides DATA: Big Wing 9/10 sorties no interception (Para 204)

**Conclusion**: Dowding was modest. Hagiographers inflated his role BEYOND his own claims.

## Challenges
- Bungay (2000): Paywalled ($15.99)
- National Archives: Not digitized (Kew visit required)
- Oct 17, 1940 meeting minutes: Primary source not found

## Lessons
- Full reading reveals evidence summaries miss
- Pattern 2 only emerged from reading complete Dowding Despatch
- 10 hours thorough vs 3 hours summary-based = fundamentally different quality

**Status**: MISSION COMPLETE
