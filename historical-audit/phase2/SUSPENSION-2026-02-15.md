**Resume Date**: TBD

## Completed Work

### Phase 2 - Thorough Standard Methodology

**Completed generals**:
1. ✅ **Dowding** (2026-02-15) - First thorough standard validation
   - 10 hours research
   - 78/100 accuracy (improved from 72/100)
   - Pattern 2 discovered (externally constructed mythology)
   - SERVICE-RECORD-2026-02-15.md

2. ✅ **von Manstein** (2026-02-15) - EXTREME propaganda case
   - 13 hours research
   - 88-92/100 accuracy
   - Pattern 3 + Pattern 5 (fabrication + strategic omission)
   - Holocaust cooperation documented (95% confidence)
   - SERVICE-RECORD-2026-02-15.md

**Mission briefs created** (not yet deployed):
- O'Connor (new general, MEDIUM risk)
- Rommel upgrade (pilot 85-90/100 → thorough standard)
- Patton upgrade (pilot 90/100 → thorough standard)
- Montgomery (research validation for 200 XP general)
- Curtis LeMay (same standard as von Manstein, civilian casualties)

**Agents deployed** (suspended immediately):
- murrow-oconnor-2 (shutdown requested)
- murrow-rommel-2 (shutdown requested)
- murrow-patton-2 (shutdown requested)

## Methodology Established

**Thorough Standard** (validated on Dowding and von Manstein):
- Full reading of all publicly accessible sources
- Explicit documentation of paywalled limitations
- 10-13 hours per general (vs 3 hours summary-based)
- 78-92/100 accuracy with documented gaps
- SearXNG integration for high-volume searches (>5 queries)

**Files**:
- METHODOLOGY-THOROUGH-STANDARD.md
- SEARXNG-INTEGRATION.md

---

## User Directives

**Quality standard**:
- "I would prefer we do a thorough job even if it takes an incredibly long time"
- "Same standard for everyone - full accounting of good AND bad"
- "I'm not asking for whitewashing. I'm asking for a full accounting in history"

**LeMay directive**:
- Same scrutiny as von Manstein
- Tokyo firebombing casualties documented unflinchingly
- No double standards (Axis vs Allied)

**Efficiency directive** (before suspension):
- "Don't stop. Do as much as you can as efficiently as possible"
- "Commit work periodically"
- Parallel deployment approach

---

## Resume Plan

**When resuming**:

1. **Check agent status**:
   - Verify murrow-oconnor-2, murrow-rommel-2, murrow-patton-2 shut down
   - Clean up any zombie processes

2. **Priority deployments**:
   - O'Connor (user's original addition)
   - Rommel upgrade (pilot needs thorough validation)
   - Patton upgrade (highest pilot score, validate)

3. **Secondary deployments**:
   - Montgomery (research validation for deployed general)
   - Curtis LeMay (controversial, same standard as von Manstein)
   - Arthur Harris (RAF Bomber Command, controversial)

4. **Parallel execution**:
   - Deploy multiple Murrow agents in background
   - 1-2 days per general
   - Commit results periodically

5. **Validation**:
   - Ensure all deployed generals have research validation
   - Update COMMAND-ROSTER.md with accuracy ratings
   - Service records for all completed research

## Current Roster Status

**43 commanders total**:
- ✅ 4 with thorough standard research (Dowding, von Manstein, Guderian pilot, Rommel pilot, Patton pilot)
- 📋 5 mission briefs ready (O'Connor, Rommel/Patton upgrades, Montgomery, LeMay)
- ⏸️ 3 agents suspended (murrow-oconnor-2, murrow-rommel-2, murrow-patton-2)
- 🔲 ~34 commanders awaiting research

**Deployed but unvalidated**:
- Montgomery (200 XP, Order of Victory) - mission brief created, needs deployment
