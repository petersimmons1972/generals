*Author's prefatory note: I lived through the London Blitz. I watched German bombs fall on Paddington and Islington. I saw what happened to people when their houses burned and their neighbours were buried. What I did not see — and what nobody around me saw — was any sign that we were about to surrender.*

*That is where this analysis begins.*

## 1. The Morale Bombing Doctrine: Theory Against Accumulated Evidence

### i. The Theoretical Basis

Let us be precise about what Harris believed, and why. The area bombing campaign was not improvised. It rested on a specific, articulable theory, which can be stated plainly enough: bomb the workers' houses and the workers will break. Break the workers and the factories will stop. Stop the factories and Germany will surrender. The theory had a name — strategic bombing doctrine — and a founding theorist, an Italian general named Giulio Douhet, who published *The Command of the Air* in 1921 and elaborated it in 1927.

Douhet's argument was simple enough to fit on a single page. Air power could bypass armies and navies and strike directly at the civilian population. Civilians, being soft where soldiers are hardened, would crack under the terror of bombardment. The resulting social chaos — food shortages, panic, mass evacuation, breakdown of utilities — would force governments to sue for peace. Stanley Baldwin gave the doctrine its most famous English expression in 1932: "The bomber will always get through." And then, quietly, the question Baldwin's remark implied: whose civilians would crack first?

The British answer to that question was worked out formally and officially in a memorandum dated 30 March 1942, written by Frederick Lindemann, Baron Cherwell, Churchill's chief scientific adviser. The Cherwell Memorandum — known within Whitehall as the "de-housing paper" — calculated that one ton of bombs dropped on a built-up area would demolish 20 to 40 dwellings and turn 100 to 200 people out of house and home. Each bomber, in its operational lifetime, would drop roughly 40 tons. Therefore each bomber would make 4,000 to 8,000 people homeless. Given the planned scale of the campaign, Cherwell concluded: "There seems little doubt that this would break the spirit of the people."

The Air Ministry directive had already been issued. On 14 February 1942 — eight days before Harris took command of Bomber Command — the directive stated that "operations should now be focused on the morale of the enemy civilian population, and in particular, the industrial workers."

Harris did not invent the doctrine. He was its most capable executor and its most ardent believer. In October 1943 he urged the government to state the purpose of the bombing campaign "unambiguously" — and his language is worth quoting at length, because it is unusually candid for a serving officer:

> "The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive...should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany."

This is not a man hiding behind euphemism. Harris meant exactly what he said. The question that should have been asked — and was not asked loudly enough — was whether any of this would work.

### ii. What the Evidence Showed

I was in London during the Blitz. Nine months of sustained German bombing, from September 1940 to May 1941. The Luftwaffe killed more than 43,000 British civilians and destroyed more than a million homes. The Home Intelligence unit of the Ministry of Information tracked British morale through this period with unusual care and candour. Its reports — secret at the time — showed that the number of suicides declined. Drunkenness declined. Pub attendance increased. Thirteen thousand people attended cricket at Lord's during the raids. The psychological researchers found approximately two cases of "bomb neurosis" per week in London during the first three months of bombing.

We did not crack.

This was not a secret. It was happening in plain view. Government ministers knew it. The Air Ministry knew it. Harris knew it. The de-housing paper, circulated in March 1942, explicitly cited analysis of the German raids on Birmingham, Hull, and elsewhere as evidence that demolishing houses was "the most effective way to affect morale." But the British had just demonstrated — in nine months of being bombed — that destroying houses produced defiance, not submission. What evidence existed that Germans were different in this respect?

None. The answer is none. The whole of the evidence pointed the other way.

The Germans had their own Home Intelligence equivalent, the SD reports (Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsführers-SS), which tracked civilian morale throughout the war. What these reports showed was precisely what the British records showed: morale dipped sharply after each major attack, then recovered. People were frightened, exhausted, and increasingly bitter about the war. They were not, however, about to rise against their government. The US Strategic Bombing Survey, which interviewed thousands of German civilians after the war, found the following:

> "The morale of the German people deteriorated under aerial attack...The people lost faith in the prospect of victory, in their leaders and in the promises and propaganda to which they were subjected. In a determined police state, however, there is a wide difference between dissatisfaction and expressed opposition."

The Survey's verdict is precise. Morale was damaged. The capacity for political opposition — the mechanism by which morale collapse was supposed to end the war — was suppressed by the Nazi state. The theory required that workers, once made miserable enough, would do something to end their misery. In Germany in 1942, 1943, and 1944, what they did was go to work, because the alternative was the Gestapo.

The doctrine assumed a democratic mechanism in a totalitarian state.

### iii. The Speer Paradox

There is a number that the defenders of area bombing prefer not to discuss. German armaments production, indexed at 97 to 98 in 1941, rose to 133 to 142 in 1942, to 216 to 222 in 1943, and to 277 in 1944. Those years — 1942 through 1944 — span the entire period of the area bombing campaign's greatest intensity. Arms production tripled between 1942 and 1944, while the weight of bombs dropped on Germany increased more than sixteenfold.

Albert Speer, who served as Hitler's Minister of Armaments from February 1942 onward, explained this paradox in his post-war testimony and in his memoir *Inside the Third Reich*. The economy he inherited was grotesquely inefficient — luxury goods were still in production, consumer goods still consumed enormous resources, the workforce was underutilised. He rationalised it. He dispersed production, shifted factories underground and into rural areas, and squeezed output from every available resource. Each wave of bombing destroyed finished goods and damaged plants, and each time the workforce repaired them. What bombing could not easily destroy was the reserve capacity that Speer had built into the system.

He also testified, with the characteristic precision of a man who had watched his economy run in real time, about which bombing actually worked:

> "If they persist at it this time, we will soon no longer have any fuel production worth mentioning."

He said this in May 1944, after the first American raids on synthetic oil plants. He was right. By June, synthetic oil production had fallen from 316,000 tons per month to 107,000 tons. By September it fell to 17,000 tons. Aviation fuel from synthetic plants dropped from 175,000 tons in April to 5,000 tons in September. The Luftwaffe was grounded not by area bombing of cities but by the precision targeting of oil.

Harris spent the better part of 1944 resisting the diversion of Bomber Command to oil and transportation targets. He resisted Zuckerman's Transportation Plan. He resisted the oil campaign. He continued bombing cities while the evidence that oil and transport would end the war mounted month by month. He was eventually overruled, and the oil campaign was authorised in May 1944. The results were as Speer had predicted.

The USSBS summary is categorical on this point:

> "The city attacks of the RAF prior to the autumn of 1944, did not substantially affect the course of German war production. German war production as a whole continued to increase."

And:

> "The attack on transportation was the decisive blow that completely disorganized the German economy."

What broke Germany was not the area bombing of its cities. What broke Germany was the destruction of its oil supply and its railways. Harris knew this by late 1944. The evidence was in front of him throughout 1943. He continued bombing cities anyway.

### iv. The Butt Report and What Changed

The area bombing doctrine was not adopted because precision bombing was working. It was adopted because precision bombing was demonstrably failing. The Butt Report of August 1941 — compiled by David Bensusan-Butt using photographic evidence — found that of all aircraft recorded as attacking their target, only one in three had gotten within five miles of it. Over Germany as a whole, the proportion was one in four. Over the Ruhr, with its industrial haze and its thick anti-aircraft defences, it was one in ten.

The Butt Report was a devastating document. It was, as the historians subsequently noted, "a painful shock, not just to the RAF but to the entire British government." Many senior officers rejected it outright. The response — the logical response, given that the bombs were not hitting anything — was to stop pretending that precision was possible and to bomb everything. If you cannot hit the factory, burn the city around it.

This logic was not entirely dishonest. In 1941 and 1942, bombing was genuinely too inaccurate for most precision work at night. The Pathfinder Force, created partly in response to the Butt Report, improved navigation considerably. By 1944, with H2S radar, Oboe beacons, and daylight bombing possible under fighter cover, precision bombing of specific industrial targets was both technically and operationally feasible. Harris did not take advantage of this. He continued area bombing while the Americans, flying in daylight, hit oil plants with increasing accuracy and devastating effect.

The Butt Report explains the initial shift to area bombing in 1942. It does not explain why the doctrine was maintained in 1944 when the constraints that justified it had substantially relaxed.

## 2. The Propaganda of Necessity: Language Analysis

### i. "De-housing"

Let us take the word at face value and see what it means.

"De-housing" means removing people from their houses. The word is passive. It describes a condition — being without a house — rather than the act that creates that condition. It implies a process that might be orderly, perhaps even beneficial; one "de-houses" mice from a grain store. The word contains no fire, no burning children, no families dragging their possessions through rubble at three in the morning. It is, as one subsequent analysis correctly identified, "a euphemism for the killing of workers, who of course tended to be asleep in their houses" during nighttime raids.

The Cherwell Memorandum's calculations were precise about tonnage and homelessness. They were silent about the ratio of dead to displaced. A bomb that demolished 20 to 40 houses did not merely render the inhabitants homeless. A bomb dropped on a sleeping city killed the inhabitants of the houses it demolished. The memorandum's arithmetic concerned itself exclusively with the surviving homeless. The dead did not appear in the calculation.

This is not an accident. Words and numbers that exclude the dead are doing a specific kind of work. They are making a policy of killing civilians legible as a policy of disrupting their living arrangements.

Blackett, the chief scientist to the Royal Navy, said the memorandum's estimates of what could be achieved were 600 per cent too high. Tizard, Zuckerman, and Bernal — three of Britain's most distinguished scientists — said they were 500 per cent too high. Cherwell, when challenged by Tizard, replied that the calculations were "for the Prime Minister's benefit, not for statistical analysis." This is a sentence worth pausing over. The scientific adviser to the Prime Minister prepared calculations for the Prime Minister that were not intended to be statistically accurate. Churchill received, and was persuaded by, figures that the men who calculated them acknowledged to be instruments of persuasion rather than tools of analysis.

The strategy that killed hundreds of thousands of German civilians was authorised partly on the basis of mathematics that its own author privately dismissed as propaganda.

### ii. The Language of the Directive

The Area Bombing Directive of 14 February 1942 directed operations to "focus on the morale of the enemy civilian population, and in particular, the industrial workers." The language is careful. Not "kill" — "focus on morale." Not "destroy cities" — "focus on...the industrial workers." The workers are mentioned as though they were a legitimate military target class, which in international law they were not. But the phrasing makes them sound like one.

Harris, characteristically, stripped the bureaucratic language away when speaking internally. His October 1943 formulation — "the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany" — is honest about what was being done in a way that the official directive was not. This is one of the strange inversions of the Harris record: the most explicit statements of the campaign's actual purpose come from Harris himself, speaking inside the government, while the public language was consistently more opaque.

Publicly, the RAF talked about "military and industrial targets." The cities being bombed had military and industrial targets in them. The fact that the bombs fell largely on houses and their inhabitants — a fact documented by the Butt Report and its successors — was not disclosed.

### iii. "Transportation Plan" vs. "Area Bombing"

By 1944 the internal debate within Allied bombing strategy had produced another set of linguistic distinctions. The "Transportation Plan," proposed by Zuckerman and backed by Eisenhower and Tedder, targeted rail marshalling yards and repair facilities. The "Oil Campaign," backed by Spaatz, targeted synthetic fuel plants and refineries. Harris called these "panacea targets" — a phrase worth noting. It implies that anyone who believed oil or railways could win the war was naive, chasing a single magic solution rather than prosecuting the grinding industrial attrition of city bombing.

The "panacea" label was applied to approaches that were demonstrably working. By late 1944, German train movements in France were down 90 percent. Fuel shortages were immobilising panzer divisions. Aircraft stood idle on runways because there was no aviation fuel to put in them. These were not panaceas. They were decisive interventions, documented in real time by German records.

Harris's characterisation of effective targeting as panacea-chasing, and of his own approach — which the evidence showed was not breaking morale and was not stopping production — as rigorous strategic thinking, is the language of a man who had invested everything in a doctrine and could not afford to question it.

### iv. Suppression from Public View

The British public did not know the casualty figures. The RAF's bombing assessment reports were classified. The growing accumulation of evidence that morale bombing was not working — the SD reports from Germany, the mounting evidence about production, the internal scientific critiques — remained within government. What the public received was the Thousand Bomber raids presented as evidence of devastating strategic effect: Cologne struck, Hamburg devastated, Berlin burning.

The effect on German war production went unreported, because accurately reporting it would have required saying that production was rising despite the bombing. The USSBS found after the war that approximately 300,000 German civilians were killed and 780,000 wounded — figures that were not published during the war. The "de-housing" language ensured that the question of how many people were dying never became a prominent part of the public debate.

The newspapers ran photographs of bombers over target. They did not run photographs of the streets of Hamburg.

## 3. Churchill's Wartime Support and Post-War Distancing: The Political Pattern

### i. Churchill's Wartime Authorization

Churchill did not merely permit area bombing. He was its political patron throughout the war. When London was under nightly attack in September 1940, he ordered 100 heavy bombers to attack Berlin, saying — and this is his own reported language — "Let 'em have it" and "Never maltreat the enemy by halves." He pledged to Londoners that their wish for retaliation would be carried out.

He authorised the Area Bombing Directive. He received the Cherwell Memorandum and found it persuasive, despite the objections of more cautious scientists. He was, as the Mission Brief for this audit correctly states, "a driving ideological force" in the campaign, not merely its passive administrator. The belief — shared by Churchill, Cherwell, and Harris — that breaking German civilian morale would end the war rested on a consistent strategic vision that Churchill held and promoted throughout the years of the bombing.

He was also, among Allied leaders, the one who expressed the only public reservations. Neither Roosevelt nor Stalin said anything comparable.

### ii. The March 1945 Memo

On 28 March 1945, Churchill sent a minute to General Ismay for the British Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff. The timing matters: Dresden had been bombed on 13 to 15 February 1945. The war was visibly won. Churchill wrote:

> "It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed. The destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing."

This is an extraordinary document in several respects. Churchill used the word "terror" — the word his own Air Ministry had spent three years avoiding. He acknowledged that the bombing had been conducted "under other pretexts" — which is to say, he acknowledged that the official justifications were different from the actual purpose. And he used the phrase "serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing," distancing himself from a campaign he had personally authorised.

Harris received the memo and responded furiously. He rejected the characterisation that he bombed for terror. Portal was sufficiently concerned about the response that Churchill was persuaded to withdraw his original minute and issue a revised version — softer in tone, omitting the word "terror."

So the first draft, which accurately described what had been happening, was withdrawn. The revised version, which obscured it, was the one that entered the record. Churchill's moment of honesty was edited out of the official correspondence.

### iii. The Political Pattern

The pattern here is not unique to Churchill. It is the standard pattern by which democratic leaders authorise mass killing in wartime and then, when the war ends and the killing becomes uncomfortable to contemplate, distance themselves from the men who did it.

Harris was denied a peerage — the only theater commander of his seniority not to receive one. Bomber Command was denied a campaign medal until 2012. These were not acts of moral judgment. They were acts of political hygiene. The aircrew who flew the sorties, the workers who built the bombs, and the commanders who ordered the raids were all implicated in something that Churchill's government, in the post-war world, did not wish to defend publicly. So they were quietly not celebrated, while the commanders of other campaigns were.

Harris understood this and said so. His bitterness in the post-war period was not the bitterness of a man who thought he had done wrong. It was the bitterness of a man who had done exactly what he was asked to do and was then treated as an embarrassment.

The parallel with LeMay in Japan is instructive. LeMay burned Tokyo on the night of 9 to 10 March 1945, killing approximately 80,000 to 100,000 civilians in a single night — more than either atomic bomb. He said privately to an aide, "If we lose, we'll be tried as war criminals." The Americans won. LeMay was never tried. He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, ran for vice president in 1968, and became one of the founding mythologists of American air power. Harris, who lost the political battle with Churchill's silence, became "Butcher Harris."

The moral question — whether it was right to deliberately bomb civilian populations — was never seriously asked of either man by the governments they served. The question of whether it worked was asked only after the fact, by survey teams interviewing Germans in the rubble.

## 4. What the Evidence Showed: BBSU and USSBS Findings

### i. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey

The USSBS, completed in 1947, surveyed the wreckage of German industry, interviewed thousands of German civilians and officials, and produced approximately 200 supporting reports. Its Summary Report on the European War contains conclusions that sit in direct contradiction to the claimed achievements of area bombing.

On the primary strategic claim — that bombing would break German civilian morale — the USSBS found that morale had "deteriorated" but that in "a determined police state...there is a wide difference between dissatisfaction and expressed opposition." The decline in morale "did not lead to an overt movement by the civilian population to end the war." The theory, in other words, was falsified by events. German civilians suffered intensely. They did not revolt.

On industrial production — the secondary claim, that bombing would reduce German war output — the findings were, if anything, worse for the area bombing doctrine:

> "The city attacks of the RAF prior to the autumn of 1944, did not substantially affect the course of German war production. German war production as a whole continued to increase."

This is the Survey's own language. Not contested. Not hedged. Area bombing, throughout its principal years of operation, did not substantially affect production.

What did affect production? The Survey is equally direct:

> "The attack on transportation was the decisive blow that completely disorganized the German economy."

And, on oil:

> "Consumption of oil exceeded production from May 1944 on. Accumulated stocks were rapidly used up, and in six months were practically exhausted."

The area bombing campaign absorbed the majority of Bomber Command's resources for three years. The decisive campaigns — oil and transport — were resisted by Harris and fought by the Americans in daylight while Harris continued his city-burning at night. The Survey's verdict is that the city bombing did not achieve what it was supposed to achieve, and the campaigns that were resisted as "panacea-chasing" turned out to be the ones that won the war.

### ii. The British Bombing Survey Unit

The British Bombing Survey Unit, less well-known than its American counterpart, reached broadly similar conclusions. Both surveys concluded that area bombing's impact on German production was limited until late 1944, when combined with oil and transport targeting the cumulative effects became decisive. Neither survey found evidence that area bombing had broken civilian morale in the way the doctrine predicted.

The BBSU's findings supported the post-war consensus: strategic bombing was important, but what mattered was targeting oil and transport, not cities. The British survey was, if anything, more reluctant than the American one to criticise the RAF's campaign publicly — a reluctance that reflects the political sensitivity of the findings in Britain, where thousands of aircrew had died carrying out a strategy the surveys were now qualifying heavily.

### iii. What Grayling Concluded

A.C. Grayling's *Among the Dead Cities* (2006) subjects area bombing to the standards of just war theory — the same standards, broadly, that informed the Nuremberg proceedings. His conclusion, reached after exhaustive historical analysis, is that area bombing was "unnecessary and disproportionate, thereby qualifying as a war crime." He poses the question directly: how would the Allies have fared if judged by Nuremberg standards?

Grayling's argument rests on three claims: that area bombing was not necessary to win the war (oil and transport bombing was more effective and could have been adopted earlier); that it was disproportionate (the civilian casualties were not commensurate with the military advantage gained from city destruction rather than precision targeting); and that it intentionally targeted civilian populations, which had been prohibited by the Hague Rules of 1923, whatever their legal status.

The defenders of area bombing typically respond with three counter-claims: that the technology in 1942 made precision bombing impossible; that the Germans bombed civilians first; and that fighting a genocidal regime permits — perhaps requires — a different moral standard.

The first claim is true for 1942 and largely false for 1944. The technology had changed. Harris had not.

The second claim is a tu quoque — "you did it first" — which the Nuremberg tribunal explicitly rejected as a legal defence, even if it retains some moral force as context.

The third claim — that the just cause of fighting Nazism justifies the means — is the hardest of the three. It is not obviously wrong. But if it is accepted without qualification, it is difficult to know where its logic stops.

## 5. The Double Standard: Why Harris Escaped Nuremberg

### i. What the Law Actually Said

Let us be precise about the law. The Hague Rules of Aerial Warfare were drawn up by a commission of jurists in 1923. Article XXII prohibited aerial bombardment "for the purpose of terrorising the civilian population." Article XXIV stated that bombing was permissible only when directed "exclusively at" military objectives, and that if military objectives were so situated that they could not be bombed without indiscriminate bombardment of the civilian population, "aircraft must abstain from bombardment."

The 1923 Hague Rules were never ratified. They had no binding force in international law. Harris said as much himself, in 1936, before he became famous: "The so-called Hague rules are not internationally binding in so far as they were never internationally accepted."

He was legally correct. There was no binding international law in 1939 to 1945 that specifically prohibited what he did. The Hague Convention of 1907, which was binding, prohibited the bombardment "by whatever means" of undefended towns, villages, and buildings. German cities were not undefended — they were heavily defended, with anti-aircraft guns, searchlights, night fighters, and extensive civil defence systems. The Convention's language about undefended towns did not obviously apply.

This legal ambiguity was the foundation on which Allied bombing rested at Nuremberg. The London Charter of August 1945 that established the tribunal explicitly limited its remit to Axis war crimes. Allied conduct was simply outside its jurisdiction. No one at Nuremberg was going to charge the victors. The tu quoque defence — that the Allies had done the same thing — was formally rejected as a legal argument by the tribunal, but in practice its shadow fell over the prosecution's decisions about which charges to bring. No German commander was charged with terror bombardment, because if terror bombardment were a war crime, the men who built the tribunal would need to answer for Cologne and Hamburg and Dresden.

### ii. The Doenitz Precedent

The practical application of this logic appeared in the trial of Admiral Karl Doenitz. He was charged with unrestricted submarine warfare — attacking merchant shipping without warning. In his defence, American Admiral Chester Nimitz testified that the US Navy had conducted exactly the same unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan from the day after Pearl Harbor. The tribunal did not acquit Doenitz of the charge. But it declined to sentence him for it. The charges relating to submarine warfare effectively disappeared.

This is the shape of the double standard: not that Allied commanders were formally acquitted of war crimes, but that the charges were never brought. The jurisdictional limitation of the London Charter, combined with the prosecutors' awareness of their own side's conduct, produced a Nuremberg that punished Axis crimes and examined Allied ones only in private.

### iii. The Asymmetry

Harris's campaign killed, by the USSBS estimate, approximately 305,000 German civilians — a figure the Mission Brief for this audit notes may be compared to the 500,000 to 600,000 figure that appears in some accounts, acknowledging the uncertainty in the historical record. German V-weapons killed approximately 9,000 British civilians in 1944 to 1945. German commanders who ordered the bombing of Rotterdam, Coventry, and Belgrade were never systematically prosecuted for those attacks, partly because the same logic that protected Allied commanders protected them: the Hague Rules were not binding, the 1907 Convention applied to undefended towns, and both sides had done it.

What distinguishes Harris from the German bombing commanders is not the legal framework — under the law as it existed, both were operating in a grey zone — but the scale. The RAF's area bombing campaign killed more civilians than German strategic bombing killed in Britain by a factor of roughly 30 to 1. The scale does not change the legal analysis. It changes the moral one.

Grayling asks how the Allies would have fared at Nuremberg. The honest answer is that we do not know, because the question was never asked. The tribunal was constituted to ask different questions. This is not a defence of what was done over German cities. It is an accurate statement of what Nuremberg was.

### iv. The Specific Exemption

The absence of prosecution was achieved through two mechanisms. First, the London Charter's jurisdictional limitation explicitly excluded Allied conduct from consideration. Second, within the Allied prosecution, a practical decision was made that charges of civilian bombing would be brought against no one — German or Allied — because the evidence would have required the tribunal to confront its own side's record.

The academic analysis is direct on this point: "the failure to prosecute 'total war' practices...has fundamentally shaped subsequent international humanitarian law." The gap at Nuremberg — the unasked questions about area bombing — was not repaired until the Geneva Protocols of 1977, which for the first time created binding international law specifically prohibiting indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations. That law was written partly in response to what Nuremberg had failed to address.

Harris was not tried because his victorious government chose not to create a tribunal that would try him. That choice was political, not legal.

## Conclusion

I am not a military historian. I spent the war writing for Tribune and the Observer, watching from London while the bombers flew over. I have no access to the classified files that the Air Ministry holds. I will say what the evidence I have examined supports.

The morale bombing doctrine was a theory about psychology that the war had already refuted before it was fully implemented. The British Home Intelligence reports showed that nine months of Luftwaffe bombing had not broken British morale. The architects of the de-housing campaign cited this same evidence as their justification. They drew the opposite conclusion from the same facts, and they were never required to explain why.

The Cherwell Memorandum that underpinned the campaign was based on calculations that its own author acknowledged were "for the Prime Minister's benefit, not for statistical analysis" — which is to say, they were propaganda. Three of the leading scientists in Britain said they were 500 to 600 per cent too high. The Prime Minister chose to believe Cherwell rather than Tizard, and 305,000 German civilians died in consequence.

The USSBS finding — "The city attacks of the RAF prior to the autumn of 1944, did not substantially affect the course of German war production" — is a verdict on what three years of area bombing achieved. The campaigns that ended Germany's capacity to fight were the oil campaign and the transportation campaign, both of which Harris resisted and both of which the Americans pursued against his wishes.

Churchill authorised the campaign. He withdrew his own memo when Harris objected to it. He denied Harris a peerage and denied Bomber Command a campaign medal, which is not a moral verdict but a political one: the silence of a man who does not wish to explain what he ordered.

Harris was not tried at Nuremberg because the tribunal was not constituted to ask the question. He was correct that the Hague Rules were not legally binding. He was also, by 1944, ignoring more effective targeting strategies that could have ended the war sooner and killed fewer people on both sides, in favour of a doctrine he had invested his professional identity in defending.

The language of the campaign — "de-housing," "morale of the industrial worker," "strategic necessity" — was the language of a policy seeking to avoid describing what it was doing in plain English. What it was doing was burning the houses of sleeping people in industrial cities. The people who authorised it knew this. They chose their words carefully to ensure that most of the people who supported it did not have to know it too.

Political language, as I have written elsewhere, is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.

The area bombing campaign was not pure wind. It did contribute, in the end, to Germany's defeat. The question was never whether it contributed at all. The question was whether it was the right contribution — whether those 300,000 dead civilians were killed in a strategy that was achieving what it claimed, or in a strategy that was achieving something different, by different means, while its practitioners used the language of strategic necessity to avoid looking squarely at what they were doing.

The evidence says: something different.

The propaganda said: nothing to see.
