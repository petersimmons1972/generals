## Key Evidence Presented by Prosecution

### The "Reichenau Order" and Manstein's Version (November 20, 1941)

**Critical documentary evidence**: Manstein signed an order on November 20, 1941, based on the "Severity Order" issued by Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau.

**Content of Manstein's Order** (November 20, 1941):

> "Jewry constitutes the middleman between the enemy in the rear and the remainder of the Red Armed Forces which is still fighting, and the Red leadership. The soldier must appreciate the necessity for the harsh punishment of Jewry, the spiritual bearer of the Bolshevist terror. This is also necessary in order to nip in the bud all uprisings which are mostly plotted by Jews."

**Fuller version**:
> "Jewry is the middleman between the enemy at our rear and the still fighting remnants of the Red Army and the Red leadership; more than in Europe, it [Jewry] occupies all key posts of the political leadership and administration, of trade and crafts and forms the nucleus for all disquiet and possible revolts."

**Alternative translation**:
> "Jewish Bolshevik system must be wiped out once and for all and should never again be allowed to invade our European living space."

**Manstein's defense**: Claimed he "remembered asking for a draft of such an order, but had no recollection of signing it."

**Analysis**:
- **Direct contradiction** with Nuremberg testimony (August 1946) where he claimed ignorance of anti-Jewish actions
- Order explicitly calls for "harsh punishment of Jewry"
- Issued November 20, 1941 (during Einsatzgruppe D operations under Ohlendorf)
- Distributed to 11th Army troops

**Actual time served**: 4 years

**Reasons for early release**:

---

## Why Acquitted on Holocaust Charges?

**Based on accessible sources**, three factors contributed to acquittal on Jewish extermination charges:

### 1. Evidentiary Standards

- Tribunal scrutinized chain of command
- Many affidavits originated from Soviet sources (potentially subject to political influence - Cold War context)
- **Found "insufficient direct linkage" between Manstein's directives and specific criminal acts**

**Analysis**: This is legally cautious but historically problematic
- Ohlendorf testimony (Nuremberg 1946) directly linked 11th Army to Einsatzgruppe D operations
- November 20, 1941 order explicitly targets Jews
- "Insufficient direct linkage" = high evidentiary bar for conviction

### 2. Defense Strategy

- Defense counsel: R.T. Paget (Labour MP), Sam Silkin
- Strategy: Contextualize documents within "exigencies of Eastern Front combat"
- Argument: Manstein's orders were "standard Wehrmacht practices for rear-area security"
- Claim: Orders did NOT "explicitly authorize racial killings or exceed military necessity"

**Analysis**: Classic "Clean Wehrmacht" defense
- November 20, 1941 order DOES explicitly target Jews ("harsh punishment of Jewry")
- "Rear-area security" = euphemism for anti-partisan operations (which included anti-Jewish measures)

### 3. Cold War Context

- Trial conducted 1949 (Berlin Blockade, NATO formation, need for West German rearmament)
- British establishment sympathetic to Wehrmacht generals (needed for Cold War)
- Manstein's supporters included influential figures (Churchill, Liddell Hart)

**Quote from defense**:
- Manstein "duty bound to obey orders"
- Questioned whether Hague Convention applied to Russia
- Called trial "victor's justice"

## Critical Analysis: The Acquittal Problem

### Contradiction Between Verdict and Evidence

**Tribunal found von Manstein**:
- ✅ GUILTY: Execution of commissars
- ✅ GUILTY: Poor treatment of POWs
- ✅ GUILTY: Scorched earth orders harming civilians
- ❌ NOT GUILTY: Extermination of Jews

**But the evidence shows**:
1. **November 20, 1941 order**: Explicitly targets Jews for "harsh punishment"
2. **Ohlendorf testimony** (Nuremberg, Jan 1946): 11th Army DIRECTED Einsatzgruppe D liquidations
3. **90,000 killed** (June 1941 - June 1942): During von Manstein's 11th Army command
4. **Simferopol order**: 11th Army requested Einsatzgruppen "hasten liquidations"

**Logical inconsistency**:
- If guilty of executing commissars (ideological killings)
- If guilty of failing to protect civilians (scorched earth)
- If signed order calling for "harsh punishment of Jewry"
- If 11th Army directed Einsatzgruppe D operations (per Ohlendorf)

**Then how NOT guilty of cooperation in Jewish extermination?**

### Possible Explanations

**Legal explanation** (tribunal's view):
- "Insufficient direct linkage" = no documentary evidence of Manstein personally ordering specific Jewish massacres
- Einsatzgruppen operated under SS authority, not Wehrmacht command
- Cooperation ≠ direct responsibility

**Historical explanation** (modern scholarship):
- Evidentiary bar set too high (required "smoking gun" orders from Manstein himself)
- Cold War political pressure to minimize Wehrmacht guilt
- British establishment reluctance to convict "professional soldiers" of genocide
- November 20, 1941 order interpreted as "anti-partisan" not "anti-Jewish" (implausible given text)

---

## Comparison: What the Tribunal Accepted vs Rejected

### Accepted as Proven:
- Commissar Order violations (**ideological killings**)
- POW mistreatment (war crime)
- Scorched earth harming civilians (war crime)
- Civilian deportation for forced labor (crime against humanity)

### Rejected as Unproven:
- Cooperation with Einsatzgruppen in Jewish extermination
- Direct knowledge of Holocaust operations
- Responsibility for 90,000 Einsatzgruppe D victims

**Pattern**: Tribunal accepted "military" war crimes, rejected "ideological/racial" crimes

**Historical verdict**: This distinction is ARTIFICIAL
- November 20 order proves ideological motivation
- Ohlendorf testimony proves operational cooperation
- Acquittal on Holocaust charges = legally cautious, historically inaccurate

## Limitations of This Analysis

**What I CANNOT verify** (paywalled sources):
1. Full trial transcript (62 days of testimony)
2. Cross-examination of von Manstein on November 20 order
3. Whether Ohlendorf testimony was presented
4. Full reasoning of tribunal for acquittal on Jewish extermination charges
5. Complete list of all 17 charges and verdicts

**What I CAN verify** (accessible sources):
1. ✅ November 20, 1941 order text (multiple sources)
2. ✅ 9 guilty verdicts, 8 acquittals (including 3 Holocaust-related)
3. ✅ Ohlendorf testimony at Nuremberg (Jan 1946)
4. ✅ Von Manstein's Nuremberg testimony (Aug 1946)
5. ✅ Sentence: 18 years → 12 years → released after 4 years

## Post-Trial: Myth-Making Begins

### Manstein's Memoir: *Lost Victories* (1955)

- Published 2 years after release from prison
- Became Cold War-era military bestseller
- Western military establishment embraced Manstein as "brilliant strategist"
- Memoir omits Holocaust involvement, November 20 order, Einsatzgruppen cooperation

### Rehabilitation

**Supporters**:
- B.H. Liddell Hart (British military historian) - wrote foreword to *Lost Victories* English edition
- Winston Churchill - pressured for early release
- Konrad Adenauer - needed Wehrmacht generals for West German rearmament
- NATO establishment - Cold War military expertise

**Result**: "Clean Wehrmacht" myth strengthened by Manstein's acquittal on Holocaust charges

---

## Conclusion: Hamburg Trial Assessment

**Legally**:
- Valid conviction on 9 war crimes charges
- Acquittal on Holocaust charges legally defensible (high evidentiary standard)

**Historically**:
- Acquittal on Holocaust charges is INDEFENSIBLE given available evidence
- November 20, 1941 order alone proves complicity
- Ohlendorf testimony proves operational cooperation
- Cold War politics influenced verdict

**Propaganda impact**:
- Acquittal on Holocaust charges enabled "apolitical soldier" myth
- Conviction on "military" war crimes allowed claim of "victor's justice"
- Manstein used acquittal to rehabilitate reputation
- *Lost Victories* memoir portrayed self as wrongly accused

**Modern assessment**:
- Manstein WAS a war criminal (9 guilty verdicts confirm)
- Manstein WAS complicit in Holocaust (evidence overwhelming despite acquittal)
- Hamburg trial verdict = Cold War compromise, not historical truth
