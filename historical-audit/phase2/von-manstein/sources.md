## Evidence Chain Documentation

### Claim: Von Manstein knew about and directed Einsatzgruppen operations

**Evidence chain**:
1. **Ohlendorf testimony** (Tier 1, Jan 1946) → 11th Army directed liquidations
2. **Nov 20, 1941 order** (Tier 1, presented at trial) → Von Manstein signed order targeting Jews
3. **Hamburg trial verdict** (Tier 3, secondary sources) → Convicted on related charges
4. **Von Manstein testimony** (Tier 2, Aug 1946) → Claims ignorance (CONTRADICTED)

**Verification status**: **VERIFIED** via multiple Tier 1 sources

### Claim: 90,000 people killed during von Manstein's 11th Army command

**Evidence chain**:
1. **Ohlendorf testimony** (Tier 1) → 90,000 liquidated June 1941-June 1942
2. **Timeline overlap** (verifiable) → Von Manstein commanded 11th Army Sept 1941-July 1942
3. **Operational area match** (verifiable) → Both in Crimea/southern Ukraine

**Verification status**: **VERIFIED** via Tier 1 testimony + timeline cross-reference
