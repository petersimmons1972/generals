### Tier 1: Nuremberg Trial Evidence

#### Von Manstein Testimony at Nuremberg (August 10, 1946)
**Status**: FULL ACCESS via Avalon Project (Yale Law School)

**Source**: https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/08-10-46.asp
**Access level**: FULL - Complete transcript retrieved
**Pages**: ~10 pages of testimony
**Reliability**: Tier 1 (testimony under oath)

**Content summary** (preliminary scan):
- Von Manstein testifies about Commissar Order
- Claims he did NOT carry out Commissar Order (disobeyed)
- Discusses treatment of prisoners of war
- Discusses "scorched earth" destruction during 1943 retreat
- Distinguishes "military" war vs "ideological" war
- Claims ignorance of concentration camp conditions

**Critical for verification**:
- Claims about disobeying Commissar Order vs evidence from his own trial
- Claims about POW treatment vs casualty figures
- Claims about limited destruction vs actual devastation
- Pattern 5 detection: Strategic omissions about Einsatzgruppen cooperation

**NEXT STEP**: Full reading with quote extraction required

#### Ohlendorf Testimony (Einsatzgruppe D Commander)
**Status**: FULL ACCESS via Famous Trials website

**Source**: https://famous-trials.com/nuremberg/1934-ohlentestimony
**Access level**: FULL - Complete testimony retrieved (76KB HTML)
**Reliability**: Tier 1 (SS commander testifying about his own atrocities)

**Content summary**:
- Ohlendorf commanded Einsatzgruppe D (operated with 11th Army)
- Testimony about mass executions in Crimea
- Details of Wehrmacht cooperation with Einsatzgruppen

**CRITICAL IMPORTANCE**: This directly contradicts von Manstein's claims of ignorance
- 11th Army = von Manstein's command during Einsatzgruppe D operations
- Ohlendorf's testimony provides Wehrmacht cooperation evidence

**NEXT STEP**: Full reading, extract Wehrmacht cooperation evidence

**Content identified**:
- Wartime photographs (Battle of Kerch, May 1942, etc.)

- March 1943 proposals for mobile reserves vs rigid assaults

**Limitations**:
- No comprehensive digitization project for von Manstein operational records
- May require German language skills for full access
- Unclear which operational documents are digitized vs physical-only

**NEXT STEP**: Direct access to Bundesarchiv search to assess what's actually digitized

## Limitations Acknowledged

**Cannot access without institutional credentials or payment**:
- Hamburg trial transcript (62 days of proceedings)
- Most academic monographs (Melvin, Smelser/Davies, etc.)
- Complete Bundesarchiv operational records

**Strategy for limitations**:
- Read ALL accessible primary sources fully
- Use secondary sources only where they cite primary evidence
- Cross-verify paywalled claims through accessible contradictory evidence
- Document explicitly what cannot be verified due to access barriers

**Estimated thoroughness with current access**: 70-80% (strong primary source access via Nuremberg, weak on Hamburg trial details)

---

**STATUS**: Access assessment in progress, beginning FULL READING of accessible Tier 1 sources now.
