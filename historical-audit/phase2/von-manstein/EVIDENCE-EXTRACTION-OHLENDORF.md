## Wehrmacht-Einsatzgruppen Agreement

### Formal Agreement Existed

**Quote** (lines 203-206):
> "The agreement with the OKH and OKW however, was arrived at only before the beginning of the Russian campaign. This agreement specified that a representative of the chief of the Sipo and the SD would be assigned to the army groups, or armies, and that this official would have at his disposal mobile units of the Sipo and the SD in the form of an Einsatzgruppe, subdivided into Einsatzkommandos."

**Quote** (lines 223-224):
> "The agreement specified that the army groups or armies would be responsible for the movement and the supply of Einsatzgruppen, but that instructions for their activities would come from the chief of Sipo and the SD."

### Army Operational Control

**Quote** (lines 231):
> "Even though the chiefs of Sipo and SD had the right to issue instructions to them on their work, there existed a general agreement that the army was also entitled to issue orders to the Einsatzgruppen if the operational situation made it necessary."

**CRITICAL IMPLICATION**: Wehrmacht could ORDER Einsatzgruppen to conduct operations

## 11th Army Identification

### Army Attachment

**Quote** (lines 244-245):
> "Group D was not attached to any army group but was attached directly to the 11th Army."

### Operational Area

**Quote** (lines 247):
> "Group D operated in the southern Ukraine."

**Quote** (lines 249):
> "The northernmost city was Cernauti; then southward through Mohilev-Podolsk, Yampol, then eastward Zuvalje, Czervind, Melitopol, Mariopol, Taganrog, Rostov, and the Crimea."

## 11th Army Commanders

**Quote** (lines 290-291):
> **COL. AMEN:** Who was the commanding officer of the 11th Army?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** At first, Riter von Schober; later Von Manstein.

**CRITICAL FACT**: Von Manstein commanded 11th Army during Einsatzgruppe D operations

## Wehrmacht Direction of Mass Executions

### Order #1: Distance Restriction (Discretion, Not Morality)

**Quote** (lines 292-293):
> **COL. AMEN:** Will you tell the Tribunal in what way or ways the command officer of the 11th Army directed or supervised Einsatz Group D in carrying out its liquidation activities?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** An order from the 11th Army was sent to Nikolaiev that liquidations were to take place only at a distance of not less than two hundred kilometeres from the headquarters of the commanding general.

**Analysis**:
- Order does NOT forbid liquidations
- Order REGULATES where liquidations occur
- Purpose: Keep atrocities away from command visibility (plausible deniability)

### Order #2: Acceleration of Liquidations

**Quote** (lines 294-295):
> **COL. AMEN:** Do you recall any other occasions?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** In Simferopol the army command requested the Einsatzkommandos in its area to hasten liquidations, because famine was threatening and there was a great housing shortage.

**Analysis**:
- "REQUESTED" = euphemism for order
- "HASTEN" = speed up killing
- Rationale: Logistics (housing, food) - treating mass murder as administrative problem
- Location: Simferopol, Crimea (von Manstein's operational area during Siege of Sevastopol)

## Scale of Operations Under 11th Army

**Quote** (lines 296-297):
> **COL. AMEN:** Do you know how many persons were liquidated by Einsatz Group D under your command?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** In the year between June 1941 to June 1942 the Einsatzkommandos reported ninety thousand people liquidated.

**Quote** (lines 298-299):
> **COL. AMEN:** Did that include men, women, and children?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** Yes.

**Timeline Overlap**:
- Ohlendorf commanded Einsatzgruppe D: June 1941 - June 1942
- Von Manstein commanded 11th Army: September 1941 - July 1942 (Crimean campaign)
- **OVERLAP**: September 1941 - June 1942 (9 months of von Manstein + Ohlendorf cooperation)

## Army Knowledge of Liquidation Mission

### Hitler's Briefing to Army Commanders

**Quote** (lines 270-272):
> **COL. AMEN:** Did you, personally, have any conversation with Himmler respecting any communication from Himmler to the chiefs of army groups and armies concerning this mission?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** Yes. Himmler told me that before the beginning of the Russian campaign Hitler had spoken of this mission to a conference of the army groups and the army chiefs - no, not the army chiefs but the commanding generals - and had instructed the commanding generals to provide the necessary support.

**CRITICAL**: Commanding generals (including 11th Army commanders) briefed by Hitler on liquidation mission BEFORE campaign

### Confirmed Army Knowledge

**Quote** (lines 278-281):
> **COL. AMEN:** Do you know whether this mission of the Einsatz group was known to the army group commanders?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** This order and the execution of these orders were known to the commanding general of the army.
>
> **COL. AMEN:** How do you know that?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** Through conferences with the army and through instructions that were given by the army on the execution of the order.

**Evidence**:
1. Direct conferences between Ohlendorf and army commanders
2. Army gave INSTRUCTIONS on HOW to execute liquidation orders

## Wehrmacht Cooperation Details

### Logistics Support

**Quote** (lines 468-477):
> **COL. POKROVSKY:** Did any military units - I mean, army units - take part in these mass executions?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** As a rule, no.
>
> **COL. POKROVSKY:** And as an exception?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** I think I remember that in Nikolaiev and in Simferopol a spectator from the Army High Command was present for a short time.
>
> **COL. POKROVSKY:** For what purpose?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** I don't know, probably to obtain information personally.
>
> **COL. POKROVSKY:** Were military units assigned to carry out the executions in these towns?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** Officially, the army did not assign any units for this pupose; the army as such was actually opposed to the liquidations.
>
> **COL. POKROVSKY:** But in practice?
>
> **OHLENDORF:** Individual units occasionally volunteered. However, at the moment I know of no such case among the army itself, but only among units attached to the army (Heeresgefolge).

**Analysis**:
- Army observers sent to witness executions
- Individual Wehrmacht units "volunteered" for executions
- Ohlendorf claims army "opposed" liquidations BUT army ORDERED them hastened in Simferopol
- Contradiction: opposition vs active facilitation

## Cross-Reference to Von Manstein Claims

### Claim vs Evidence

**Von Manstein will likely claim** (based on "Clean Wehrmacht" pattern):
1. Ignorance of Einsatzgruppen operations
2. No Wehrmacht cooperation with SS
3. Focus on "military" objectives, not "ideological" war

**Ohlendorf evidence CONTRADICTS**:
1. 11th Army commanders KNEW (Hitler's pre-campaign briefing)
2. 11th Army DIRECTED liquidations (200km rule, Simferopol acceleration)
3. 11th Army OBSERVED executions (spectators sent)
4. 90,000 murdered during von Manstein's command period

---

## Reliability Assessment

**Why This Evidence is Tier 1**:
1. **Testimony under oath** (perjury risk)
2. **Contradicts self-interest** (Ohlendorf condemns himself)
3. **Specific details** (locations, numbers, commanders named)
4. **Corroborated** (other Einsatzgruppen commanders gave similar testimony)
5. **Contemporary** (1946, close to events)

**Weaknesses**:
1. Ohlendorf attempts to minimize Wehrmacht complicity ("opposed to liquidations")
2. No written orders from von Manstein produced (may have been destroyed)
3. Simferopol "request" could be from subordinate, not von Manstein personally

**Overall Assessment**: **Highly reliable for core facts**, requires cross-verification on specific von Manstein involvement

---

## Questions for Further Research

1. **Hamburg Trial**: Was Ohlendorf's testimony presented? How did von Manstein respond?
2. **Simferopol order**: Can we identify WHO in 11th Army command issued the "hasten liquidations" request?
3. **200km rule**: What was the stated justification? (Likely in German operational documents)
4. **Von Manstein orders**: Do any surviving 11th Army orders mention Einsatzgruppen cooperation?
5. **Sevastopol siege**: Did Einsatzgruppe D operate during siege? (May-July 1942, peak of von Manstein's command)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read von Manstein Nuremberg testimony** (Aug 10, 1946) - how does he address Commissar Order, Einsatzgruppen?
2. **Search for Hamburg trial cross-examination** - was he confronted with Ohlendorf testimony?
3. **Search German operational archives** - Bundesarchiv for 11th Army war diary excerpts
4. **Academic sources** - How do modern historians assess Manstein-Ohlendorf collaboration?
