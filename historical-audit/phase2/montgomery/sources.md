## PRIMARY SOURCES (Tier 1-2)

---

### UK National Archives WO 201 Series (8th Army Operational Records)

**Access level**: BLOCKED - Physical access only (Kew, London)
**Tier**: 1
**Relevance**: Contains Montgomery's operational orders for El Alamein; Auchinleck's preparation documents; would definitively resolve Alam Halfa credit question
**What we CANNOT verify**: Whether Auchinleck's operational orders were substantively identical to Montgomery's execution; exact wording of El Alamein orders vs. post-war memoir claims
**Limitation impact**: HIGH - This is the single most important inaccessible source

---

### UK National Archives WO 285 Series (21st Army Group Records)

**Access level**: BLOCKED - Physical access only (Kew, London)
**Tier**: 1
**Relevance**: Pre-D-Day operational orders for Caen; Normandy campaign planning documents
**What we CANNOT verify**: Whether D-Day orders specified Caen as D-Day objective or holding operation; whether Montgomery's post-war "always intentional" claim is supported or contradicted by his own orders
**Limitation impact**: HIGH - Central to the Caen controversy

---

### Eisenhower Presidential Library SHAEF Records

**Access level**: BLOCKED - Physical/institutional access required
**Tier**: 1
**Relevance**: Eisenhower's contemporary assessments of Montgomery; SHAEF operational directives; broad front vs. narrow thrust debate in real time (not retroactively)
**Identified via**: SearXNG search result noting "SHAEF Selected Records and SHAEF SGS Records"
**Limitation impact**: HIGH - Contemporary Eisenhower assessment unavailable

---

### Churchill Archives Centre (Cambridge)

**Access level**: BLOCKED - Physical access required; no digitized correspondence accessible
**Tier**: 1
**Relevance**: Churchill-Montgomery correspondence during 1942-1945; Churchill's private assessments vs. public praise

---

### Alexander's Official Dispatch on Alam el Halfa (Original and 1947 Revision)

**Access level**: SUMMARY (indirect, via 1962 NYT article metadata from SearXNG)
**Tier**: 1
**Source**: New York Times, 1962 - "Alexander Says He Revised '42 Battle Report; Change Stirs an Uproar"
**What was accessed**: Title and brief description only (NYT article paywalled)
**Evidence extracted**: Alexander admitted revising his official dispatch about the 1942 Battle of Alam el Halfa; the "1947 revision...linked Field Marshal Montgomery with successful plans"
**Significance**: CRITICAL - Documents that the post-war official record was altered to credit Montgomery more prominently
**Limitation**: Full text of the revision and the original dispatch not accessible

- Three-volume authorized biography
- "considered to be an apologist but also shows the negative side"
- Later revised as *The Full Monty* (2001)
- "reveals both strengths and weaknesses"

## CRITICAL ACCESS GAPS

The following questions CANNOT be definitively answered from accessible sources:

1. **Did Montgomery's operational orders specify Caen as D-Day objective?** (Requires WO 285)
2. **Was Auchinleck's Alam Halfa plan identical to what Montgomery executed?** (Requires WO 201)
3. **What did Eisenhower's contemporary efficiency reports say about Montgomery?** (Requires SHAEF records)
4. **Exactly what did Alexander's original vs. revised dispatch say about Alam Halfa?** (Requires archival access)
5. **What is the full Buckley/French/Beevor/Atkinson academic assessment?** (All paywalled)

These gaps mean the research conclusions depend heavily on SearXNG-mediated summaries of secondary sources. The accuracy rating must reflect this limitation.
