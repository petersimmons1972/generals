## Opening

I covered six wars on four continents. I watched a lot of men in authority deflect blame with fluency and conviction. The skill comes naturally to those who command at distance — the man who conceived the plan is rarely the man whose body is recovered from a Dutch field or a Norman orchard.

Bernard Montgomery died in 1976 at eighty-eight, peacefully, in Hampshire. The men he sent to Arnhem were not so fortunate. He called their destruction ninety percent successful.

This is not a prosecution. It is an accounting. The record is specific about where Montgomery succeeded and specific about where he failed — and it is damning on the question of whether he ever acknowledged the failure that mattered most.

## I. The Human Cost of His Decisions: Caen and the Normandy Bloodletting

### What the Plan Said

The D-Day operational orders were unambiguous: Caen was to fall on the evening of June 6, 1944. Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey's operational order stated that Caen was "a D-day objective, with Villers-Bocage to be captured on D+3-4." This is not disputed. The plan said one day.

The city was not fully taken until July 18, 1944 — forty-two days after the landing.

### What That Cost

Between D-Day and the end of August 1944, British, Canadian, and Polish forces suffered approximately 83,000 casualties, of whom nearly 16,000 were killed. These figures span the entire Normandy campaign, not Caen alone — but the Caen sector consumed the bulk of British effort and blood.

The individual operations tell their own story:

**Operation Epsom** (June 26 - July 2, 1944): The 15th Scottish Infantry Division alone suffered 2,331 casualties — 288 killed, 1,638 wounded, 794 missing — in the first days. Total Epsom casualties ran approximately 5,300 men.

**Operation Charnwood** (July 8-9, 1944): I Corps suffered 3,817 casualties in three days. The 3rd Canadian Division sustained 1,194 casualties — 330 dead, 864 wounded. The Canadians suffered more casualties taking half of Caen than they had suffered on D-Day itself.

**Operation Goodwood** (July 18-20, 1944): British I and VIII Corps suffered 3,474 casualties. Canadian forces lost an additional 1,965. In tanks — the largest British armored engagement of the war — approximately 314 were knocked out, of which 130 to 253 were total write-offs, against approximately 75 German tank losses. A 4:1 or 5:1 exchange ratio in German favor.

The city of Caen itself suffered approximately 3,000 civilian deaths. On June 6 alone, RAF bombers killed at least 600 French civilians. When Montgomery ordered the July 9 air assault, 450 heavy bombers dropped 2,500 tons — but pilots released early to avoid British lines, meaning German defenses largely survived while the city was destroyed. Historian Antony Beevor called the bombing of Caen "Montgomery's greatest act of folly." Some French historians have used stronger language.

### The Methodical Approach: Did It Save Lives or Prolong Killing?

This is a genuine question that deserves a genuine answer rather than hagiography in either direction.

Montgomery's defenders argue, with some justice, that his caution conserved British manpower that could not be replaced. By August 14, 1944, he was writing to Brooke: "My infantry divisions are so low in effective rifle strength that they can no — repeat NO — longer longer fight effectively in major operations." The British War Office had already warned that if infantry casualties continued at recent rates, divisions would have to be cannibalized. Montgomery knew he was commanding a wasting asset.

The problem is not his awareness of the manpower constraint. The problem is what he chose to do with it.

He concealed the constraint from Eisenhower and from SHAEF. He allowed American commanders to believe that the Caen operations represented genuine offensive intent when he knew — and his orders to subordinates demonstrated — that they were holding operations. He let American generals spend their impatience on operations he had privately re-scoped. The deception did not save lives. It poisoned the coalition that was fighting the war and left thousands of British and Canadian soldiers fighting a battle whose real objectives their commander would not state plainly to his allies.

Whether the methodical approach produced lower casualties than alternatives is not fully resolvable. What is documented is that Montgomery's communication to his superiors about what he was doing was dishonest — and that dishonesty had consequences beyond mere diplomatic friction.

## II. Arnhem: The Men He Failed

### The Plan

Operation Market Garden was conceived by Montgomery in September 1944 and approved by Eisenhower on September 12. The operation would launch on September 17 — five days after approval. There were no planning maps when the orders were issued.

The plan required three airborne divisions to seize a corridor of bridges across sixty-four miles of Dutch territory, terminating at the Rhine bridge at Arnhem. XXX Corps, driving up a single two-lane road, was to relieve the furthest division — the British 1st Airborne — within forty-eight hours. The bridge at Arnhem was the critical objective.

The 1st Airborne would be dropped eight miles from the bridge they were meant to seize. This decision was made because of concerns about anti-aircraft fire over Arnhem itself. It was the decision that doomed the operation.

### The Intelligence They Knew and Chose to Ignore

This is not a case where the intelligence was ambiguous.

On September 5, ULTRA decryptions specifically identified the 9th SS Panzer Division and 10th SS Panzer Division as having been transferred to the Arnhem area for rest and refit. Dutch Resistance also provided warnings. Major Brian Urquhart, chief intelligence officer for British I Airborne Corps, ordered aerial reconnaissance; the photographs confirmed armored vehicles in woods near the planned drop zones. He raised his concerns formally.

Browning placed Urquhart on medical leave for "nervous exhaustion" to silence him.

On September 15 — two days before the operation — Eisenhower's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, visited Montgomery personally to raise the intelligence about the SS Panzer divisions. Smith recommended using two airborne divisions at Arnhem rather than one, to account for the threat. Montgomery "ridiculed the idea and waved my objections airily aside."

The operation proceeded with one division. The division landed eight miles from its objective. The SS Panzers were waiting.

### The Cost

Of approximately 10,600 men who fought north of the Rhine at Arnhem:

- Approximately **2,100 were evacuated** in the withdrawal of September 25-26
- **1,485 were killed** in battle
- **6,414 were taken prisoner** (roughly one-third of them wounded)
- Total casualties exceeded 80 percent of the division's strength

General Roy Urquhart, commanding the 1st Airborne, was "struggling to think of a reason to justify their sacrifice."

**Access level**: Casualty figures from CWGC (Commonwealth War Graves Commission) via WebSearch and Pegasus Archive (pegasusarchive.org). The Bedell Smith dismissal is documented in accounts from Smith himself, cited in multiple secondary sources including Warfare History Network.

### What Montgomery Said About It Afterward

He said it was ninety percent successful.

His logic: the operation had captured ninety percent of its territorial objectives. The ten percent it missed — the bridge at Arnhem — had been the entire purpose of the operation. The men who died to take that bridge were not honored by this arithmetic. They were folded into a calculation designed to protect his reputation.

In his memoirs, Montgomery wrote: "If the operation had been properly backed from its inception, and given the aircraft, ground forces, and administrative resources necessary for the job, it would have succeeded in spite of my mistakes, or the adverse weather, or the presence of the 2nd Panzer Corps in the Arnhem area. I remain Market-Garden's unrepentant advocate."

Read that phrase again. *Unrepentant advocate.* The 1st Airborne Division lost over 8,000 men dead, wounded, or captured. The intelligence was available, was delivered personally to Montgomery by Eisenhower's chief of staff, and was dismissed. And he remained unrepentant.

Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who had watched his country occupied and watched British paratroopers destroyed in his fields, said this: "My country cannot afford another success from Montgomery."

### The Scapegoating of Sosabowski

There is a coda to Arnhem that belongs in the record.

On October 5, 1944 — ten days after the withdrawal — Montgomery wrote to Polish General Stanislaw Sosabowski praising his soldiers' courage. He was "very pleased" with them. He mentioned possible awards.

Nine days later, on October 14, 1944, Montgomery wrote a different letter — this one to British commanders. In it he stated that "the Polish Para Brigade fought very badly and the men showed no keenness to fight if it meant risking their own lives." He said he did not want them under his command.

Sosabowski was removed from his command on December 27, 1944.

The facts of the Polish Brigade's performance at Arnhem are not in dispute by serious historians: they were dropped seven kilometers from the bridge they were meant to reinforce, without adequate communications, against SS armor, in conditions not of their making. Their casualties approached forty percent. Brian Urquhart — the intelligence officer who had been silenced before the operation — called Montgomery's treatment of Sosabowski "grotesque" and his dismissal "a shameful act."

The man who had ignored the intelligence warnings that could have saved the operation found a foreign general to blame for its failure. He then destroyed that general's career. He did this in writing, within weeks of the operation, while his own private letters told a contradictory story.

## III. The Post-War Damage to His Allies

### The January 1945 Press Conference

On January 7, 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge, Montgomery held a press conference at his headquarters in Belgium. He had been given temporary command of American forces on the northern shoulder of the German breakthrough, and he wanted to explain the Allied response.

What emerged from his mouth was something different.

Montgomery described, for more than an hour without notes, how he had assessed the crisis, taken necessary steps, "tidied" the battlefield, and steadied the Allied line. He referenced "the whole Allied team rallying to the call." He praised Eisenhower's friendship. And then he described, with evident satisfaction, how he personally had taken command and sorted things out.

The American generals present — and the American newspaper editors who received the reports — heard something else. The Ninth Army war diary complained: "He sees fit to assume all the glory and scarcely permits the mention of an army commander's name." General Bradley concluded that Montgomery was attempting "to discredit me so he could get control of the whole operation" and told Eisenhower: "I cannot serve under Montgomery."

Churchill later described the press conference as "jingoistic and self-satisfied" and was forced to work diplomatically to prevent a formal rupture between American and British command. Eisenhower admitted privately that "no single incident that I have encountered throughout my experience as an Allied commander has been so difficult."

Montgomery himself later concluded: "I think now that I should never have held that press conference. So great were the feelings against me on the part of the American generals that whatever I said was bound to be wrong."

This is one of the rare occasions where he conceded error. Note what he conceded: that the press conference was a tactical mistake because of how it was received. He did not concede that his characterization of events was wrong.

### The 1958 Memoirs

Montgomery published his memoirs in 1958, thirteen years after the war ended and in the same year he retired from NATO — where he had served as Eisenhower's deputy for seven years.

The memoirs were, by the standards of diplomatic memoir-writing, incendiary. He described Eisenhower as "a remarkable and most lovable man" and then wrote: "He had never seen a shot fired in war till the landings in North Africa and he never commanded troops in battle." He argued that Eisenhower's broad-front strategy had unnecessarily prolonged the war, that the European conflict could have ended in 1944 had his narrow-thrust proposals been adopted, and that American generalship had been structurally inferior to British.

Regarding Claude Auchinleck, he claimed that upon arriving in Egypt in August 1942, Auchinleck had shown him only plans for retreat up the Nile. This was demonstrably false. What Auchinleck had shown him was the complete strategic plan — with the Nile retreat as a contingency, not an intention. Auchinleck had already stopped Rommel at the First Battle of El Alamein, had developed the defensive plan for Alam Halfa (which Montgomery then executed), and had established the defensive line that made El Alamein possible. Montgomery did not mention the First Battle of El Alamein. He did not credit Auchinleck's preparations. He took the inheritance and presented it as originality.

Auchinleck threatened a lawsuit. Montgomery was forced to make a public recantation on the BBC. Auchinleck never held a significant command again.

Eisenhower, reading the memoirs in 1958 in the White House, did not speak to Montgomery again. In conversations with Cornelius Ryan in the last years of his life, Eisenhower called Montgomery "a psychopath" and "egocentric" — words that carried specific meaning from a man who had spent years trying to manage Montgomery's ego in the service of Allied unity. Eisenhower "railed about Montgomery until the day he died."

The memoirs caused such damage to transatlantic relations that Churchill — who had maintained a warm personal friendship with Montgomery throughout the post-war decades, who had visited Chartwell with him forty-eight times — found the publication an embarrassment. No evidence exists of Montgomery retracting the Eisenhower criticisms, apologizing to Eisenhower personally, or acknowledging that the memoir characterizations were unjust.

**Access level for memoirs controversy**: The Auchinleck lawsuit and BBC recantation are documented in multiple secondary sources (spartacus-educational.com, war history online, multiple WebSearch results). The Eisenhower "psychopath" quote is from Cornelius Ryan's research (widely cited in secondary sources). Full text of Montgomery's memoirs is accessible at Internet Archive but was not fully read; key passages quoted in secondary sources. **Limitation**: Direct access to the BBC broadcast transcript not confirmed.

## IV. His Treatment of Subordinates

### The Pattern

Montgomery operated on a principle he never disguised: officers who did not meet his standard were removed, and removed publicly. He saw this as essential to military effectiveness. He was not wrong about its operational purpose. The question is whether the manner matched the necessity.

**Herbert Lumsden** commanded X Corps armour at El Alamein. When Lumsden's tanks failed to break through German minefields on the night of October 23-24 — a genuine tactical problem, not cowardice — Montgomery summoned corps commanders to a midnight conference and threatened to replace anyone who lacked offensive spirit. The implicit target was Lumsden. Their relationship had soured at Dunkirk, and Montgomery carried that forward into command. Lumsden was dismissed in December 1942. He was sent to the Pacific as a liaison officer and was killed by a Japanese kamikaze strike in January 1945. His professional reputation never recovered.

**Francis de Guingand** was Montgomery's chief of staff throughout the North Africa, Sicily, and Northwest Europe campaigns, and by broad consensus the man who repeatedly translated Montgomery's directives into workable operations while managing the allied relationships that Montgomery's personality damaged. Montgomery himself wrote after the war: "Anything I have been able to achieve during the late war could not have been done if he had not been at my side." Omar Bradley wrote of de Guingand's "patience, modesty, and understanding which helped to forge the Allied armies into a single fighting machine." De Guingand's devotion to duty, in the assessment of those who worked alongside him, ruined his health and brought him near a nervous breakdown.

After the war, their friendship suffered because de Guingand's memoirs did not cast Montgomery in an entirely favorable light. Montgomery's fine words about de Guingand's indispensability "all too often failed to live up to his treatment of his former chief of staff, especially after the war ended." A man whose career Montgomery built on, who had saved him during the Bulge crisis, who had sacrificed his health in Montgomery's service — was distanced when he told the truth.

**The systematic dismissals**: Montgomery was by his own account systematic about removing officers he considered unfit. During his command of Southern England before D-Day he removed officers who did not meet his fitness and training standards with a thoroughness unusual even in wartime. His chief of staff de Guingand described his primary role as keeping "Bernard's two great virtues — will and discipline — in tandem." This required managing a man whose coercive leadership style produced compliance through fear as much as inspiration.

**The Sosabowski case** is the most documented abuse. A foreign general who warned — correctly — that Market Garden was poorly planned, who led his men with forty-percent casualties into an impossible situation, was blamed in writing nine days after Montgomery had praised him in writing. The timeline matters: October 5 (praise), October 14 (condemnation), December 27 (removal). Montgomery destroyed Sosabowski's career to protect his own reputation.

### The Effect on Command

The effect on operations is documented but not fully quantifiable from accessible sources. What is documented is the diplomatic and command friction: Bradley's "contempt had grown into active hatred" (a senior British general at SHAEF); Eisenhower's admission that the press conference was the most difficult incident of his Allied command experience; the sustained American view — from Patton, Bradley, and Eisenhower — that Montgomery's arrogance was not merely personality but operationally harmful.

The Sicily campaign illustrates the operational dimension. When Alexander gave Montgomery the highway route (Route 124) that had been promised to the Americans in July 1943, Patton and Bradley were genuinely insulted and the relationship between the two armies deteriorated. General Leese, Montgomery's own XXX Corps commander, later reflected that retaining the highway for the Americans "might have had a chance to end this frustrating campaign sooner." Montgomery's priority mattered more to him than the efficiency of the Allied effort.

## V. The Auchinleck Question: Professional Responsibility

The case of Claude Auchinleck is the clearest example of Montgomery's post-war conduct as a form of ongoing harm.

Auchinleck commanded the 8th Army from June 1941 to August 1942. He stopped Rommel at the First Battle of El Alamein — a defensive victory that saved Egypt and the Suez Canal. He developed the defensive plan for Alam Halfa that Montgomery subsequently executed. He selected the El Alamein defensive position, exploiting the Qattara Depression to prevent the flanking maneuvers that had destroyed earlier British positions. These are not contested facts. Multiple historians, including Correlli Barnett, have argued that the July 1942 battle represents "the true turning-point" — before Montgomery arrived.

Auchinleck was removed by Churchill in August 1942, after political pressure from London reached breaking point. The removal was politically driven as much as operationally justified. He was offered the Middle East Command in a reduced form and declined. He subsequently commanded in India. He never held a field command again.

After the war, Auchinleck held himself aloof from the "battle of the memoirs." He wrote nothing for publication. He accepted an enhanced knighthood. His reticence, one biographer observed, "has tended to increase and not diminish his reputation."

Montgomery's 1958 memoirs attacked him anyway.

The specific claim — that Auchinleck showed Montgomery only retreat plans — was not merely historically inaccurate. It was personally defamatory of a man whose military career was already over, who had chosen silence over self-defense, and who had laid the groundwork for the victories that made Montgomery's reputation. Auchinleck was forced into the indignity of threatening legal action to compel a public correction from a man who had benefited from his work.

Field Marshal Alexander had already revised his official 1942 dispatch in 1947 to link Montgomery's name more closely to the Alam Halfa success — post-war manipulation of the primary historical record, confirmed by a 1962 New York Times report. Montgomery's 1958 attack on Auchinleck was the second time the historical record was weaponized against a man who had made Montgomery's success possible.

There is no evidence that Montgomery ever acknowledged this debt.

## VI. Verdict: Where the Record Requires Accountability

The question posed to this investigation was not whether Montgomery was a capable commander. He was. He demonstrated competence in set-piece warfare, in restoring the morale of battered armies, in coordinating complex logistics. His armies were trained and supplied and led with organizational discipline that produced results.

The question was: where did he fail his soldiers and his allies, and did he ever acknowledge it?

### Where He Failed His Soldiers

**Caen**: The six weeks of fighting for a D-Day objective resulted in tens of thousands of British and Canadian casualties, 3,000 French civilian deaths, and the destruction of a city that might have been bypassed or taken more quickly under different tactics. Whether alternative approaches would have produced lower casualties is uncertain. What is certain is that Montgomery concealed his actual operational intentions from his superiors while the fighting continued — a deception that undermined his allies' ability to make informed strategic decisions.

**Arnhem**: This is the central case. The 1st Airborne Division was destroyed — eighty percent casualties — by an enemy whose presence had been detected, reported formally, delivered personally to Montgomery by Eisenhower's chief of staff, and dismissed. The intelligence officer who raised the alarm was silenced. The operation was launched on a plan that gave the troops no margin for error, dropped them eight miles from their objective, and required XXX Corps to cover sixty-four miles of a single road in forty-eight hours. When the plan failed, Montgomery declared it ninety percent successful and blamed lack of resources, the weather, and ultimately the Polish Brigade commander.

He wrote, and apparently believed: "I remain Market-Garden's unrepentant advocate."

The men at Arnhem deserved better than unrepentance.

**The Polish Brigade**: Sosabowski warned correctly about the plan, fought to forty-percent casualties in impossible conditions, and was destroyed professionally in writing by the man who had praised him nine days earlier. This was not military justice. This was deflection. The career of a competent officer — a man who had been right — was sacrificed to protect a reputation.

### Where He Failed His Allies

**The Battle of the Bulge Press Conference**: He conceded this was a mistake. He did not concede that his characterization of events was inaccurate. The concession was tactical, not moral.

**The 1958 Memoirs**: He published a sustained attack on Eisenhower's competence while Eisenhower was President of the United States. He defamed Auchinleck with a false claim. He was forced by lawsuit threat to recant the Auchinleck claim on the BBC. He was not forced to retract the Eisenhower characterizations and did not choose to. Eisenhower never spoke to him again. The damage to Anglo-American relations was real and documented.

**Sicily and the Route 124 Dispute**: His seizure of the highway promised to American forces was not militarily necessary and was operationally counterproductive. His own corps commander, after the war, said the Americans might have ended the campaign faster with access to that road. Montgomery's prestige took priority over campaign efficiency.

### Did He Ever Acknowledge It?

The record is specific.

He acknowledged that the Battle of the Bulge press conference was a mistake — not in its substance, but in its reception.

He acknowledged, in his memoirs, that Market Garden had involved "mistakes" — this is the word he used: "it would have succeeded in spite of my mistakes." He does not specify what those mistakes were. The word "mistakes" appears embedded in a sentence designed to exonerate him, attributing ultimate failure to inadequate support.

He recanted the specific defamation of Auchinleck on the BBC, under legal compulsion.

He never expressed regret for what happened to the 1st Airborne Division. He never publicly acknowledged that intelligence warnings were available and dismissed. He never acknowledged Sosabowski's treatment as unjust. He never acknowledged Auchinleck's foundational contribution to the victories that made his name.

He died at eighty-eight, in Hampshire, honored and titled.

Major General Urquhart, who commanded the 1st Airborne at Arnhem, "was struggling to think of a reason to justify their sacrifice."

Montgomery had a reason ready. He always did. He called it ninety percent successful and remained its unrepentant advocate until the day he died.

That is not the record of a man who reckoned with what he had done. It is the record of a man who was very good at writing the history before anyone else could.
