I ought to begin with a confession. I spent six years writing about how political language disguises failure, inflates the mediocre, and absolves the guilty. I set out rules. "Never use a long word where a short one will do." "Never use the passive where you can use the active." I argued, in "Politics and the English Language" (1946), that the great enemy of clear language is insincerity — that when there is a gap between real and declared aims, the writer instinctively reaches for long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting ink. I had imperialists in mind, and fascists, and Stalinists. I confess I did not think to examine Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.

I was wrong to miss him. Montgomery's post-war prose — his memoirs, press conferences, and public declarations — is a casebook application of every technique I described. He is in some ways more instructive than the politicians I had in mind, because his subject is not ideology but a professional record. He is not obscuring the Holocaust with bureaucratic language; he is obscuring the loss of 400 tanks in a single operation with the phrase "the battle was going very well." The scale is smaller. The technique is identical.

What follows is a dissection. I will use Murrow's statistical verification as my foundation — he has done the facts; I am here for the language — and I will try to be exact about the mechanisms.

## 1. The Machinery of Self-Construction

Montgomery's self-mythology rests on four structural elements, which together constitute a propaganda apparatus of considerable sophistication.

**(i) Controlling the archive through publication**

Montgomery was faster to print than any of his Allied contemporaries. *El Alamein to the River Sangro* appeared in 1948, *Normandy to the Baltic* in 1947 — before the ink was dry on the official histories, before the German archives were fully processed, before the wartime participants had organized their own memories. His 1958 *Memoirs* came a generation before serious revisionist scholarship (Correlli Barnett's *The Desert Generals* appeared in 1960; Buckley's *Monty's Men* not until 2013). Montgomery understood, intuitively, what every propagandist understands: the first account becomes the default account. Every subsequent revision is measured against it, framed as "revisionist," treated with the vague suspicion we extend to those who contradict established truth.

He also employed a personal press agent during the war — Captain Keating — an institution unparalleled among senior British commanders. Slim wrote no wartime press handouts. Auchinleck gave no press conferences about himself. Montgomery retained a professional image-manager in the field. The machinery was not improvised; it was institutional.

**(ii) The personal pronoun as instrument**

Read any passage of Montgomery's post-war prose and count the first-person singular. It dominates with a consistency that is not accidental. The syntactic habit reveals the argumentative structure: *I* planned; *I* transformed; *I* saw; *I* took certain steps. The passive voice, which in Orwellian analysis is the coward's refuge — "mistakes were made"; "the bridge was not taken" — appears only when things go wrong. When things go right, the active "I" claims them. When they go wrong, the construction shifts to impersonal forces: "the weather," "the supplies," "the ground commanders."

This is not a quirk of personality. It is a system.

**(iii) Redefining the battlefield post hoc**

Montgomery's most sophisticated technique is what I will call objective retroversion: the practice of announcing, after the battle, that what he had originally planned to win, he had always intended merely to draw. A position fails to fall; Montgomery explains he never wanted it to fall, only to attract. A breakout fails; Montgomery explains it was always a fixing operation. The technique is impervious to ordinary criticism because it makes every outcome evidence of the original design. A plan that proceeds on D-Day is confirmed. A plan that fails for six weeks is confirmed more deeply — the delay was deliberate.

The logical structure is unfalsifiable. Which is to say, it is not an argument at all. It is the form of an argument without the substance.

**(iv) The scapegoat ladder**

Montgomery's failures never terminate in his own planning. They descend a chain: Eisenhower did not supply enough resources. The Corps commanders were too slow. The Polish Brigade did not fight with sufficient determination. The weather was unfavorable. Each rung of this ladder removes the failure one step further from his own desk. By the time it reaches the bottom, the catastrophe has been attributed entirely to circumstance, and Montgomery reappears as the figure who nearly succeeded despite everyone else's inadequacy.

This is not modesty. It is the structural form of self-exoneration.

## 2. Specific Language Patterns with Examples

I will work from documented sources, distinguishing direct quotation from paraphrase. All quotations verified through Murrow's research or my own searches; access limitations noted explicitly.

**The "according to plan" formulation**

Multiple sources document Montgomery's compulsive recourse to this phrase when operations were, in fact, not proceeding according to any plan he had stated before the event. The RAF academic assessment describes the pattern clinically: Montgomery "insisted that everything was going 'according to plan'" even when "the plan had blatantly failed." The Quora source describes his applying the formula when operations "were well off the rails."

This is not simply optimism. A man who says "the operation is proceeding according to plan" when the armor has stalled in the minefields is not projecting confidence for morale purposes; he is creating a false contemporaneous record that can be cited afterward. The phrase is prospective fraud.

**The Goodwood declaration: "Operations this morning a complete success"**

On the afternoon of July 18, 1944 — the opening day of Operation Goodwood — Montgomery telegraphed Field Marshal Brooke (Chief of the Imperial General Staff): *"Operations this morning a complete success. … The effect of the bombing was decisive."*

The facts, as established by multiple sources: British forces lost 270 tanks and 1,500 men on that first day alone. Over the three-day operation, British and Canadian losses exceeded 400 tanks — against approximately 75 German vehicles lost. The advance gained eleven kilometers. Eisenhower was "understandably disappointed and angry that he had been misled" (confirmed by multiple sources, including HistoryNet). He had previously received copies of Montgomery's orders to subordinates calling for Falaise — a town far in the German rear — as an objective; Montgomery had then revised these orders but "neglected to forward copies of the revision" to Eisenhower's headquarters. The Supreme Commander was therefore operating from a false picture when Montgomery's "complete success" telegram arrived.

This is not accidental ambiguity. The communications to SHAEF showed one thing; the orders to ground commanders said another; the message to Brooke was a third version. Montgomery's own subsequent account acknowledged he was "too exultant at the Press conference I gave during GOODWOOD" — a remarkable admission, because it concedes the public declaration was disproportionate, which means he knew it was disproportionate, which means the exultation was not honest enthusiasm but manufactured announcement.

**The Market Garden "ninety percent" claim**

After Operation Market Garden failed at Arnhem in September 1944 — destroying 80 percent of the 1st Airborne Division as a fighting force, with approximately 6,500 taken prisoner — Montgomery maintained that the operation was "ninety percent successful." His justification: the Allies had captured ninety percent of the route. The Arnhem bridge, the objective that gave the operation its entire strategic purpose, was the ten percent that failed.

This is arithmetic deployed as euphemism. A man who claims that a bridge operation was "ninety percent successful" because everything except the bridge was taken is applying to military failure the same technique by which a surgeon might describe a death as a ninety percent successful operation because nine of the ten incisions were correct. The figure is technically derivable; its purpose is psychological, not analytical.

Montgomery's own post-war statement on Market Garden is documented: "I remain Market-Garden's unrepentant advocate." And then the blame-descends: "if the operation had been properly backed from its inception, and given the aircraft, ground forces, and administrative resources necessary for the job, it would have succeeded in spite of my mistakes, or the adverse weather, or the presence of the 2nd Panzer Corps in the Arnhem area."

Read that sentence carefully. Note the small concession — "in spite of my mistakes" — which appears to accept partial responsibility, then is immediately bracketed and overwhelmed by the list of structural factors (logistics, weather, German presence) that would have caused failure "in spite of" any mistake. The admission is a grammatical maneuver. It inserts "my mistakes" into the causal chain while assigning them no causal weight.

**The Bulge press conference: "I took certain steps myself"**

On January 7, 1945, Montgomery held a press conference about the Battle of the Bulge. He said: *"As soon as I saw what was happening, I took certain steps myself to ensure that if the Germans got to the Meuse they would certainly not get over the river."*

Historian Alex Kershaw documented the effect: "The picture Montgomery gave of the battle was of massive American blundering: only when he had been brought in to command the armies holding the northern shoulder had catastrophe been averted."

Max Hastings characterized the use of the personal pronoun as "vainglorious folly." Churchill, in private, described the press conference as "jingoistic and self-satisfied."

What is technically interesting about the sentence is what it does not claim. Montgomery does not say "I won the battle." He says "I took certain steps." The indefinite article and the vague noun ("steps") give him grammatical deniability — he can later say he merely described his coordination role. But the syntactic emphasis — *I took, I saw, I ensured* — performs the claim of personal agency he wishes to convey while giving him verbal cover against it. It is the rhetorical equivalent of a man who does not take your wallet but moves it to a place where it falls into his pocket.

**The Auchinleck erasure: "listened in amazement"**

Montgomery described his meeting with Auchinleck before taking command by saying he "listened in amazement" to the plans shown him — plans he characterized as involving retreat up the Nile. This formulation served simultaneously to diminish Auchinleck and to position Montgomery as the figure who replaced defeatism with resolution.

In his 1958 *Memoirs*, Montgomery made this characterization explicit enough that Auchinleck threatened legal action. The result: a forced radio broadcast on November 20, 1958, in which Montgomery expressed "his gratitude to Auchinleck for having stabilised the front at the First Battle of Alamein." The next printing of the *Memoirs* carried a formal correction.

We should stop here, because this is extraordinary. A Field Marshal who has published a memoir containing a characterization of a rival so false that it requires a legal threat, a public broadcast retraction, and a printed erratum has not made an error of emphasis. He has made a false statement of fact. The retraction is not an interpretation of the historical record; it is evidence that Montgomery's original account was not an interpretation either. It was a lie. A lie that required a public correction in the year of the memoir's publication.

This does not embarrass Montgomery in his own subsequent writing. He describes himself in the *Memoirs* as a model of clarity and honesty. The gap between the claim and the retraction is visible to anyone who looks, but the machinery of self-construction relies on the fact that most people do not look. The memoir's general reputation persists; the erratum is a footnote.

## 3. The El Alamein Erasure — Evidence Assessment

The "Victor of Alamein" narrative rests on a foundation that contains, at its structural center, a man who has been removed from the photograph.

That man is General Sir Claude Auchinleck.

**What the record shows** (following Murrow's evidence chains, with additions from my own searches):

**a) First Battle of El Alamein (July 1942)**

Auchinleck commanded the 8th Army during the First Battle of El Alamein, which ran from July 1-27, 1942. Rommel's advance toward Alexandria was stopped during this battle. By mid-July, Rommel had been thrown into a defensive posture. The Suez Canal was secure. Rommel's attempt to break through was definitively repulsed before Montgomery arrived in Egypt.

Montgomery arrived in August 1942. The strategic crisis that Churchill framed as Montgomery's inheritance — "Rommel's Afrika Korps stood 60 miles from Alexandria" — had been resolved by the man Montgomery replaced. The 60 miles stood between Rommel and Alexandria; it also stood between Rommel and defeat.

This is not a small omission from Montgomery's account. It is the structural omission. Everything in the "Victor of Alamein" mythology depends on the reader believing that Montgomery arrived to imminent catastrophe and produced victory from crisis. The record shows he arrived after crisis, and produced victory from advantage.

**b) Alam Halfa defensive plan**

When Auchinleck was relieved in August 1942, he left behind a documented defensive plan for the anticipated German assault at Alam Halfa ridge. The plan was drafted primarily by his chief of staff, Major-General Eric Dorman-Smith. The World War II Database states directly: "Most of the British plan for this battle was actually devised, not by Montgomery ... [but by] Auchinleck's Chief of Staff, Major-General Eric Dorman-Smith." A separate source confirms that "Dorman-Smith was an architect of the strategy that won the first battle of El Alamein."

Montgomery implemented this plan in the Battle of Alam Halfa (August 31 — September 7, 1942) — his first engagement in command. He did not create it. He executed it.

Dorman-Smith subsequently "forced the publishers of Montgomery's memoirs to include acknowledgments crediting Auchinleck." That this acknowledgment had to be forced — through legal pressure, not professional generosity — tells us everything about Montgomery's natural instinct in these matters.

**c) The revision of the official record**

Murrow's research identified a 1962 New York Times article reporting that Field Marshal Alexander had admitted revising his official 1942 dispatch in 1947 to "link Field Marshal Montgomery with successful plans." This is documented alteration of a primary official source to benefit Montgomery's historical standing. Full text is paywalled; the fact of the revision is confirmed.

**d) Material reality at El Alamein**

Montgomery fought the Second Battle of El Alamein with:
- Approximately 195,000 troops vs. Rommel's 96,000
- 1,029 tanks vs. approximately 510 Axis tanks (200 fully capable)
- 730-750 aircraft vs. Axis air inferiority
- ULTRA intelligence decryption of Axis communications, of which Rommel remained unaware
- Rommel absent from the battlefield (sick in Germany for the operation's opening)
- A German supply position so critical that Rommel had explicitly warned he could not conduct effective operations without the promised 6,000 tons of fuel, which he did not receive

Montgomery won under circumstances that provided overwhelming material advantage, comprehensive intelligence dominance, and an enemy commander who was absent and undersupplied. This does not mean the battle was easy — it required genuine skill to manage. But it does mean that the mythology of a lone British general conjuring victory through tactical brilliance is a selective account. The victory was real. The mythology is not.

**Access limitation**: The full Fennell academic study ("'Steel my soldiers' hearts': El Alamein Reappraised," JMSS, 2011) is paywalled; only metadata accessed. The argument that morale transformation at El Alamein was partly mythological cannot be confirmed or denied through accessible text. The National Archives WO 201 series (8th Army operational records) would provide definitive primary source comparison between Auchinleck's plans and Montgomery's orders; physical access to Kew required.

## 4. Market Garden — The Gap Between Record and Memoir

Montgomery proposed Operation Market Garden. Eisenhower approved it on September 12, 1944. Both men bore responsibility for authorizing a plan with significant known weaknesses; but Montgomery conceived it, planned it, and operated under it.

**What the intelligence record shows**:

Before the operation launched on September 17, 1944, the following warnings existed:

- Major Brian Urquhart, British intelligence officer attached to Browning's airborne corps, discovered aerial reconnaissance photographs showing German armored vehicles in the Arnhem area. He brought this to command attention. He was subsequently sent on medical leave for "exhaustion" — a dismissal that is documented.
- Dutch Resistance reported that the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions (Hohenstaufen and Frundsberg) were refitting north of Arnhem. These reports reached Allied intelligence through multiple channels.
- ULTRA decryptions flagged German armored strength in the area. The DTIC paper "Operation Market Garden: Ultra Intelligence Ignored" (ADA406941 — the full text returned a 403 error but the title and premise are confirmed) documents specifically that high-level intelligence was dismissed.

Multiple academic sources (accessible via SearXNG searches) confirm: "The most significant intelligence failure of Market Garden was the gross underestimation of German military capability" and "operational-level commanders failed to adequately weigh intelligence reports" about SS Panzer divisions near Arnhem. The Warfare History Network states: "the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions were both in the Arnhem area on September 17, 1944, and provided a hot reception for the lightly armed British paratroopers."

General Browning himself expressed reservations. His phrase — that Arnhem was "a bridge too far" — has become famous as a film title. Less famous is the fact that he voiced this concern and the operation proceeded.

The 1st Airborne Division sustained approximately 80 percent casualties. Approximately 6,500 men were taken prisoner. Roughly 2,000 escaped.

**What Montgomery's account shows**:

Post-war, Montgomery identified four reasons for Market Garden's failure: insufficient priority at Supreme Headquarters; airborne forces "dropped too far away from the vital objective"; unfavorable weather; and underestimated German capability. He accepted "personal blame for the positioning error" (one phrasing of his account, cited by Spartacus Educational) — though this acceptance, as with the Market Garden "ninety percent" formulation, is grammatically isolated from the larger causal structure, where Eisenhower's failure to supply resources is the primary explanation.

His conclusion: "I remain Market-Garden's unrepentant advocate."

The word "unrepentant" is precise. It does not claim the operation succeeded. It claims it should have been attempted. It converts a discussion of outcome into a discussion of intention, and then defends the intention. This is the rhetorical form of a man who insists he was right to fire the gun while declining to discuss where the bullet went.

The blame-scapegoating of General Sosabowski and the Polish Parachute Brigade is documented from multiple sources. The Battle of Arnhem website records that Montgomery "designated Polish paratroopers under General Sosabowski as scapegoats, claiming they hadn't fought well at Arnhem." Sosabowski was relieved of command. He has since been completely rehabilitated by the Polish and Netherlands governments, including a posthumous medal. The scapegoating is not a matter of historical debate; it is established.

**The gap between record and memoir**:

The memoir presents Market Garden as a nearly successful operation undone by circumstances beyond Montgomery's control, primarily Eisenhower's resource allocation. The record shows an operation launched against documented intelligence warnings about the specific German units that destroyed it, planned in seven days, with a planning timeline several sources identify as insufficient, commanded by an officer who responded to intelligence about German armor by sending the warning officer on medical leave.

This is not the same story.

**Access limitation**: Montgomery's actual memoir text for Market Garden is not fully accessible in online sources. The claim that he "accepted personal blame for the positioning error" is cited from Spartacus Educational, a secondary compilation. The 1958 *Memoirs* physical text would be required to verify the exact phrasing and proportional emphasis of his Market Garden account.

## 5. The Caen Revision — Evidence Assessment

The Caen controversy is the clearest single case of objective retroversion in Montgomery's career. Here the documentary record is unusually clear.

**What the pre-operation plans said**:

Montgomery briefed Allied commanders on May 15, 1944. The British 3rd Infantry Division received orders "to seize Caen on D-Day or alternatively, dig in short of the city." Dempsey's operational order (pre-D-Day, contemporary): "Caen is a D-day objective, with Villers-Bocage to be captured on D+3-4." Murrow's research identifies a planning document specifying Caen would fall "on the evening of D-Day, June 6, 1944."

Multiple sources confirm the 21st Army Group's May 1944 planning documents treated Caen as a D-Day objective. None of the accessible pre-operation documents describe it as a deliberate "holding operation" or "magnet" for German armor.

**What happened**:

Caen fell on July 18, 1944 — forty-two days after D-Day. Even then, only half the city was initially secured. Eisenhower wrote to Montgomery on July 7 acknowledging his strategy of "holding firmly with your left, attracting thereto all of the enemy armor" — but this letter is evidence that by July 7 Eisenhower had *come to understand* what Montgomery was now telling him the strategy was. It is not evidence that this was the original pre-D-Day design.

The distinction is critical. A general who fails to take D-Day objectives and then, when asked, describes the failure as having been deliberate all along is not explaining a plan; he is manufacturing a retrospective explanation. Eisenhower's July 7 letter accepts Montgomery's current framing — it does not confirm the framing was present from the start. Eisenhower's pre-operation correspondence expected "the early capture of the important focal point of Caen."

The most precise available verdict comes from S.J. Newland: "The magnet strategy was a fiction as evidenced by Eisenhower's continued encouragement for Montgomery to take Caen, his D-Day objective." This is cited in our searches; the underlying source (Newland's *The European Campaign*) is not fully accessible online, but the quotation is clear enough.

The Baldwin Battlefield Tours article — directly accessed, substantial — provides a nuanced account that Montgomery's "operational level plan was sound" but that he "failed to adequately brief troops on geographic versus strategic objectives" and had a habit of "claiming infallibility and backtracking on predictions." This is a careful formulation but it establishes the pattern: the narrative revision occurred.

**The Goodwood variant**:

Operation Goodwood (July 18-20, 1944) adds a further dimension. The evidence Murrow and I have independently assembled from multiple sources makes the following clear: Montgomery sold Goodwood to Eisenhower as a potential breakout operation (contemporary evidence from Eisenhower, Tedder, and the orders copies forwarded to SHAEF). Montgomery sold Goodwood to the press as a complete success on the first day. Both claims turned out to be false. He then reframed Goodwood post-war as having always been a holding operation — the same claim he made about Caen.

The pattern of using "holding operation" as the post-hoc explanation for British armor not advancing is so consistent across both Caen and Goodwood that it ceases to be coincidence and becomes method.

**Access limitation**: Pre-D-Day operational orders are in UK National Archives WO 285 series (21st Army Group records). Physical access to Kew required. The absolute resolution of the Caen controversy — definitively establishing that no pre-operation document described a "holding operation" — would require this access. What the accessible record shows is strong circumstantial evidence and academic consensus (Newland, multiple secondary sources) against the post-war claim.

## 6. The Systemic Pattern

Having examined the individual cases, the pattern is clear enough that I do not need to argue it. I can simply describe it.

Montgomery operates a four-stage system, consistently applied across multiple operations spanning his entire wartime career:

**Stage 1 — Promise a large outcome**. Montgomery announces objectives in categorical terms: Caen on D-Day; a breakthrough at Goodwood; a path to Berlin by Christmas through Market Garden. He cultivates an image of infallible planning. His press agent ensures the announcements register publicly.

**Stage 2 — The outcome is not achieved**. The first armor stalls in minefields at El Alamein; Caen does not fall; Goodwood's 400 tanks are destroyed; the Arnhem bridge is "a bridge too far."

**Stage 3 — Redefinition**. The original objective is retroactively replaced with a description of what actually happened, now presented as what was always intended. El Alamein becomes a "set-piece battle of attrition" (which it largely was, but not entirely on Montgomery's initial plan). Caen becomes a "magnet" for armor. Goodwood becomes a holding operation. Market Garden becomes "ninety percent successful."

**Stage 4 — External assignment of residual responsibility**. Whatever cannot be explained by retroactive redefinition is attributed to Eisenhower's resource allocation, Corps commanders' sluggishness, the weather, the Polish Brigade, terrain, or the supply situation. The chain of blame descends from Montgomery until it reaches someone — or something — with less access to a printing press.

The Sicily evidence confirms this is not Normandy-specific. At Operation Husky (1943), Montgomery's forces failed to reach Messina before Patton. American staff criticism of Montgomery's conduct was documented. Montgomery's slowness allowed German forces to evacuate to Italy before they could be cut off. None of this appears in Montgomery's subsequent narrative of his brilliance in the Mediterranean.

The post-El Alamein pursuit confirms it further. After the Second Battle of El Alamein, Britannica records that "the initial pursuit of Rommel was not sufficiently direct or extensive to catch the bulk of the forces retreating along the coast road." The decisive victory that "destroyed Rommel's Afrika Korps" (as the mythology has it) actually allowed the bulk of Rommel's force to escape north along the coast. The destruction came months later, in Tunisia, and was not Montgomery's achievement alone. This does not appear in the "Victor of Alamein" account.

**The Auchinleck case is the most instructive**:

Montgomery's treatment of Auchinleck tracks the four stages perfectly. He arrived after Auchinleck had stopped Rommel (stage 2 had already been resolved). He inherited Auchinleck's defensive plans (stage 1 of the next operation). He then erased Auchinleck from the record — "listened in amazement" to defeatist plans, transformed the demoralized army. When this erasure proved factually indefensible, he was compelled to make a BBC radio broadcast on November 20, 1958, acknowledging Auchinleck's contribution, and to issue a printed correction in subsequent editions of his *Memoirs*.

This is the most verifiable instance in the record, because we can see the lie and the retraction in the same documented year.

**What this tells us about the language**:

Orwell's rules for dishonest political language identify the passive voice as a primary tool of evasion: "mistakes were made" hides agency. Montgomery inverts this selectively. When claiming success, he is aggressively active: *I planned, I saw, I took steps.* When allocating failure, he shifts to the impersonal: *the weather*, *the supplies*, *the ground commanders.* He uses the active voice as a credit-claiming device and the passive or impersonal as a responsibility-evading device — applying each to the correct purpose with considerable consistency.

The other technique is what might be called the subordinate clause absorption. Note the Market Garden formulation: the operation "would have succeeded in spite of my mistakes, or the adverse weather, or the presence of the 2nd Panzer Corps in the Arnhem area." The words "my mistakes" appear; they are not denied. But they are absorbed into a subordinate clause within a conditional sentence whose conclusion ("it would have succeeded if properly backed") is the controlling claim. The mistake is named and then neutralized in the same sentence. This is technically not a lie. It is more sophisticated than a lie. It is a grammatical structure that produces the effect of honesty while protecting the central claim.

**Claims that require qualification for the above reasons**:
- The exact phrasing of Montgomery's Auchinleck characterization in the 1958 *Memoirs* — confirmed as legally actionable; exact text not independently verified through accessible source
- The precise extent of Montgomery's Market Garden account — secondary sources agree on the "90 percent" and "unrepentant advocate" formulations; proportional emphasis of blame distribution requires the full text
- The pre-operation Caen orders — the existence of documents treating Caen as a D-Day objective is confirmed from multiple sources; the definitive primary sources (WO 285 series) are physically inaccessible

Where my analysis depends on these inaccessible sources, I have relied on consistent secondary reporting across multiple independent sources. I have not cited a single secondary source for any claim I consider central.

## Verdict

Montgomery is a more capable propagandist than most military commanders because he is also a capable commander. He has real victories behind him. The genuine achievement at El Alamein — whatever its proper proportion between his skill and Auchinleck's preparation — was a real victory. Lüneburg Heath was a real German surrender. These achievements provide cover for the machinery. It is easier to inflate a genuine achievement than to manufacture one from nothing. The myths cluster around facts the way barnacles cluster around a rock.

But the machinery is real, and it is systematic. The four-stage pattern — announce, fail, redefine, externalize — appears across El Alamein (Lightfoot's opening failure, then the "set-piece attrition" framing), Caen (D-Day objective, then "always a magnet"), Goodwood (breakout, then "holding operation"), Market Garden (ninety percent success, unrepentant advocate), and the Bulge press conference (I took certain steps). It is not possible that this pattern is accidental. A man who consistently finds that his operations achieved precisely what he always intended them to achieve, and that failures are consistently attributable to the inadequacy of others, is not describing reality. He is managing it.

The BBC radio broadcast of November 20, 1958 is the key document. Not because it is the most dramatic — though a Field Marshal forced to make a public retraction of his own memoir is fairly dramatic — but because it is the most forensically clean. It tells us that Montgomery wrote something factually false about Auchinleck. It tells us he was aware enough of the falsity that legal threat produced retraction. And it tells us that the falsity served a purpose — the erasure of Auchinleck from the foundation of the "Victor of Alamein" narrative — that was sufficiently important to Montgomery that he wrote it into his memoir in the first place.

Political language, I wrote in 1946, is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. Montgomery did not deal in murder or lies of the ordinary sort. He dealt in credit — credit for other men's plans, credit for tactical adaptations disguised as original designs, credit for victories that owed more to material superiority and inherited preparation than to personal genius. The appearance of solidity he constructed around these claims is the "Victor of Alamein" mythology, and it has lasted, in substantially uncorrected form, for the better part of eighty years.

That, I think, is the standard against which political language should be measured. Not whether it is untrue in the vulgar sense — Montgomery did not invent his battles — but whether it reliably obscures the relationship between what was promised and what was delivered, between who did the work and who received the credit, between genuine achievement and manufactured legend. By that standard, the machinery of self-construction that Montgomery built and maintained for thirty years is a considerable achievement in its own right.

He would not, I think, have appreciated the observation.
