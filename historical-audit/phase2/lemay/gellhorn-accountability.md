## I. OPERATION MEETINGHOUSE: THE FACTS

**March 9-10, 1945. Tokyo.**

At midnight, 334 B-29 Superfortresses lifted off from Guam, Saipan, and Tinian. They carried 1,665 tons of M-69 incendiary bombs — napalm-filled cylinders designed not to destroy machinery or military installations, but to ignite Japanese wooden cities. The target: the Shitamachi district of Tokyo, a dense working-class residential neighborhood — the Asakusa, Honjo, and Fukagawa wards — four miles by three miles of the most densely packed civilian housing in the world.

LeMay had made four tactical decisions that define what this mission was:

**Decision 1: Strip the guns.** LeMay ordered all defensive armament removed from the bombers, except tail guns, along with their gunners and ammunition. This reduced weight allowed double the normal bomb load. He accepted the risk to his crews in order to carry more fire.

**Decision 2: Fly low.** Instead of the standard high-altitude precision bombing approach (25,000 feet), LeMay ordered the bombers down to 5,000-9,000 feet. At low altitude, napalm dispersed more effectively over wooden structures. Targeting accuracy was not the point.

**Decision 3: Fly at night.** Night bombing eliminated the requirement to identify specific military targets. In darkness, the crews dropped on coordinates — on a neighborhood.

**Decision 4: Target a residential district.** The operational target was not an aircraft factory, a railroad marshaling yard, a port facility, or a military installation. It was Shitamachi — chosen specifically because its density of wooden structures would burn efficiently, and because it contained small cottage industries dispersed among the residential housing.

The official mission statement reads that the purpose was to destroy "industrial and strategic targets *not* to bomb indiscriminately civilian populations." The choice of Shitamachi tells you what the statement was worth.

### The Death Count: What We Know and How We Know It

Multiple counting authorities produced estimates from different methodologies:

| Source | Deaths | Methodology |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| US Strategic Bombing Survey (1946) | 87,793 killed, 40,918 injured | Post-war survey of Japanese records |
| Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department | 97,000 killed, 124,711 total casualties | Contemporary Japanese police records |
| Tokyo Fire Department | ~97,000 killed | Contemporary fire department records |
| Bodies physically recovered | 79,466 | Counted remains |
| Standard historical estimate (Britannica, WWII Museum) | "approximately 100,000" | Synthesis of above |

**What these numbers mean in practice:** The fire that followed the bombing burned 15-16 square miles of central Tokyo in under three hours. 267,000 buildings destroyed. More than one million people left homeless in a single night.

LeMay's own assessment, made years later, dispenses with euphemism:

> "We scorched and boiled and baked to death more people in Tokyo on that night of March 9-10 than went up in vapor at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined."

He was right about the arithmetic. The atomic bomb at Hiroshima killed approximately 80,000 people immediately; Nagasaki approximately 40,000. The single night of March 9-10 exceeded both.

## II. THE FULL CAMPAIGN: MARCH TO AUGUST 1945

Operation Meetinghouse was not an aberration. It was the template.

From March through August 1945, the XXI Bomber Command under LeMay's command conducted the most destructive air campaign against a civilian population in recorded history. Meetinghouse was the opening strike.

**Campaign totals (USSBS Summary Report, Pacific War):**

> "Total civilian casualties in Japan, as a result of 9 months of air attack, including those from the atomic bombs, were approximately 806,000. Of these, approximately 330,000 were fatalities."

The breakdown of that figure against bombing types:
- Atomic bombs (Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined): approximately 120,000-246,000 total deaths (range reflects delayed radiation casualties)
- Conventional firebombing campaign, 67 cities: approximately 333,000 killed (most commonly cited estimate; some sources give 300,000-350,000)

**The arithmetic that matters:** The conventional firebombing campaign killed more people than the atomic bombs. This fact is almost entirely absent from popular American memory of the Pacific War.

**Cities destroyed:** 67 Japanese cities firebombed. 180 square miles of urban area burned. 40 percent of Japan's urban areas destroyed. 60 percent of Tokyo itself consumed.

**The pace:** Following Meetinghouse, LeMay's bombers struck Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe within the next five days in March 1945, destroying a combined 32 square miles. When the large cities ran short of space that would burn, the campaign moved to medium-sized cities, then smaller ones. By summer 1945, B-29s were targeting cities of 60,000 people.

**Comparison to atomic bombs:** The destruction from conventional firebombing exceeded that of the atomic weapons in total human life. What the atomic bombs achieved was concentrated into two strikes of spectacular visible horror. What LeMay's campaign achieved was dispersed across five months and 67 cities — which is perhaps why it receives less moral attention.

## III. LEMAY'S OWN WORDS

LeMay left an unusually clear record of his own thinking. His statements fall into three categories: self-justification, acknowledgment of what he knew he was doing, and a frank recognition that his actions might constitute crimes.

### Category 1: The Justification

**On why firebombing was necessary:**

LeMay argued that precision bombing against Japan was simply not working. Weather over Japan was extreme — cloud cover at high altitude obscured targets, and B-29 crews placed less than 6 percent of their bombs within 1,000 feet of designated targets under the precision approach. He dismissed precision doctrine:

> "That's just about like searching for the Fountain of Youth."

This is not entirely self-serving. The weather problem was real. His predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, had been relieved precisely because his precision bombing campaign was producing inadequate results. Hansell himself had protested orders to conduct area bombardment, believing precision attacks were beginning to work. Whether Hansell was right — whether a longer precision campaign targeting Japan's electrical grid and industrial infrastructure would have been effective with fewer civilian casualties — is a genuine question that LeMay chose not to wait to answer.

**On what he was trying to achieve:**

> "You've got to kill people, and when you kill enough of them, they stop fighting."

And separately:

> "If you kill enough of them, they stop fighting."

These are not strategic assessments of industrial capacity. They are statements of a theory of war in which killing civilians is itself the mechanism of victory. LeMay understood he was not primarily attacking industrial targets. He was attempting to break the will of a population through mass death.

### Category 2: Explicit Denial of Civilian Innocence

The most significant quote in LeMay's record on this subject is sourced to a post-war interview cited in Michael Sherry's *The Rise of American Air Power* (Yale University Press, 1987), p. 287:

> "There are no innocent civilians. It is their government and you are fighting a people, you are not trying to fight an armed force anymore. So it doesn't bother me so much to be killing the so-called innocent bystanders."

This is not a statement about collateral damage. It is a doctrinal assertion that the category of "civilian" does not apply in the kind of war he was fighting. LeMay is explicitly articulating a theory of collective guilt — that the Japanese civilian population bore responsibility for their government's war, and therefore that their deaths required no special moral accounting.

This is the total war doctrine stated without apology.

**Source note:** The exact source of the "no innocent civilians" quote is the Sherry interview. The libquotes.com version reads slightly differently: "There are no innocent civilians, so it doesn't bother me so much to be killing innocent bystanders." Both versions are consistent in meaning. Source access: SUMMARY (Sherry is paywalled; the interview quotation is widely cited across multiple independent scholarly works).

### Category 3: The War Criminal Acknowledgment

The most discussed of LeMay's statements — and the most important for moral accounting — appears in multiple forms in his post-war statements:

Full reconstruction of the quote, from multiple sourced versions:

> "Killing Japanese didn't bother me very much at that time. I suppose if I had lost the war, I would have been tried as a war criminal. Every soldier thinks something of the moral aspects of what he is doing. But all war is immoral and if you let that bother you, you're not a good soldier."

**Source:** The statement appears in a post-war interview cited as "LeMay's interview with Sherry" (after the war), also referenced in the New York Times. Robert McNamara, who participated in planning the firebombing as a statistical officer on LeMay's staff at Guam, directly quoted the core statement in Errol Morris's documentary *The Fog of War* (2003):

McNamara (from the film transcript):

> "LeMay said, if we'd lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals. And I think he's right. He, and I'd say I, were behaving as war criminals. LeMay recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost. But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?"

**What this means:** LeMay was not expressing remorse. He was stating the logic of victor's justice — that the determination of what constitutes a war crime is made by the winners. He did not say he had done wrong. He said he would have been *treated as if* he had done wrong, had the war gone differently. These are not the same thing. He then continues with the suggestion that soldiers cannot let moral considerations interfere with soldiering.

There is no record of LeMay expressing genuine remorse for the civilian deaths in Japan. In his memoir *Mission with LeMay* (Doubleday, 1965), he presents the firebombing campaign as a military success story. The tone is managerial and operational. The word "remorse" does not apply.

## IV. THE LEGAL QUESTION: WHAT INTERNATIONAL LAW SAID IN 1945

This question has a clear answer and a complicated answer. They are both true.

### The Clear Answer: The Hague Rules of Air Warfare (1923)

The most specific applicable international law was the Hague Rules of Air Warfare, drafted by a Commission of Jurists at The Hague in December 1922 - February 1923. The relevant articles:

**Article 22:** Bombardment designed to terrorize the civilian population, to destroy or damage private property not of a military character, or to injure non-combatants, is prohibited.

**Article 24(2):** Permitted targets are defined as "military forces, military works, military establishments or depots, manufacturing plants constituting important and well-known centres for the production of arms, ammunition or characterized military supplies, lines of communication or of transport which are used for military purposes."

**Article 24(3):** "Any bombardment of cities, towns, villages, habitations and buildings which are not situated in the immediate vicinity of the operations of the land forces, is forbidden."

The firebombing of Shitamachi — a residential district of Tokyo — would be prohibited under Article 24(3). Shitamachi was not in the vicinity of land operations. It was a civilian neighborhood.

**The complicated answer: The Hague Rules were never ratified.**

No nation ever formally ratified the 1923 Hague Rules. They were drafted by jurists from public pressure, not from state demand. When World War II began, they had no binding legal force under international law. Most air forces of the major powers treated them as non-binding guidelines.

The applicable binding treaties in force in 1945 were:
- Hague Convention IV (1907), Annex: The laws and customs of war on land — applicable to land forces, not aircraft
- Hague Declaration (1899): Prohibited projectiles from balloons — but not aircraft, which did not yet exist in meaningful form in 1899

**The result:** A significant legal void existed for aerial bombardment. The Allied nations had a gentlemen's understanding about not being the first to bomb civilian areas — a norm they explicitly invoked to justify the strategic bombing campaigns as retaliation for German and Japanese attacks on cities. But this was a political arrangement, not an enforceable legal one.

**Why LeMay was not prosecuted:**

At the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE — the Tokyo Trials), the prosecution explicitly confined itself to Japanese conduct. The tribunal refused to admit defense evidence about Allied bombing campaigns. Dutch Justice Röling later acknowledged: "It was horrible that we went there for the purpose of vindicating the laws of war, and yet saw every day how the Allies had violated them dreadfully."

American defense counsel Ben Bruce Blakeney argued that if Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor was murder, then the man who released the atomic bomb on Hiroshima should be named. The tribunal rejected this line of argument.

The reasoning for non-prosecution of Allied bombing commanders rested on two pillars:
1. **Legal ambiguity** — No binding international law explicitly prohibited area bombing of civilians from aircraft
2. **Victor's prerogative** — The Allies were conducting the trials; Allied conduct was excluded from the tribunal's jurisdiction by the charter itself

**Was the firebombing a war crime under 1945 law?** Strictly speaking, with the 1923 Hague Rules unratified, a court in 1945 could not have secured a conviction under binding positive law. But the conduct clearly violated the *spirit* of international humanitarian law as understood since the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions. The 1923 Rules existed precisely because jurists recognized that the conduct was morally intolerable. They failed to get state ratification. That failure does not constitute moral approval.

**Grayling's assessment (A.C. Grayling, *Among the Dead Cities*, Bloomsbury, 2006):** Grayling argues the area bombing campaigns against both Germany and Japan were moral crimes — they were intentional attacks on non-combatants, they were unnecessary for military victory, and they were disproportionate. He concludes that Britain and America "must confess to these crimes." His critics note that his argument about necessity is stronger than his argument about legal prohibition.

## V. THE MILITARY NECESSITY ARGUMENT: EVIDENCE FOR AND AGAINST

The standard justification for the firebombing is a utilitarian calculation: the campaign shortened the war, saved lives (Allied and Japanese) that would have been lost in a land invasion, and was therefore justified despite the civilian toll. This argument must be examined against the evidence, not accepted as given.

### The USSBS Conclusion

The most authoritative American assessment of strategic bombing's effectiveness in the Pacific is the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, completed in 1946 by a team that included Paul Nitze and Robert McNamara. The USSBS Summary Report (Pacific War) states verbatim:

> "Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated."

**If this conclusion is correct,** the military necessity argument for the scale of civilian killing is substantially weakened. The war would have ended before November 1945 through blockade and the cumulative effects of both conventional bombing and naval interdiction — without the need for the most destructive raids.

The USSBS also documents that the firebombing campaign was effective in destroying Japanese war production and breaking civilian morale. It found that "one of the important factors inducing Japan's leaders to accept unconditional surrender was a realization that the Japanese armed forces had lost their ability to protect the people." The campaign contributed to surrender — but the question is whether the specific scale of civilian killing was the necessary mechanism.

### The Counter-Argument: Frank and the Revisionist Historians

Richard B. Frank's *Downfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire* (Random House, 1999) directly contests the USSBS conclusion. Frank argues that the Emperor and the Japanese military were not close to surrender in August 1945, that the USSBS authors selectively ignored evidence from Japanese leaders' interrogations that supported continued resistance, and that the atomic bombs — and by implication the entire shock campaign — were necessary to produce surrender when they did.

Frank's argument rests on evidence of Japan's military preparations for the defense of the home islands (Operation Ketsu-Go), including mobilization of 28 million civilians for resistance, stockpiling of aircraft for kamikaze attacks, and the military's genuine willingness to accept national destruction rather than surrender on Allied terms.

**The honest assessment of this dispute:**
- Both the USSBS and Frank draw on primary Japanese sources
- The USSBS was produced by the victors and had institutional incentives to justify conventional bombing effectiveness
- Frank's sources show Japanese military leaders were not prepared to surrender in July 1945 — though this does not prove they would not have by October or November without an invasion
- Soviet entry into the Pacific War on August 8, 1945 was a separate shock that Japanese accounts consistently cite as decisive — the USSBS conclusion that even Soviet entry alone was insufficient is contested

**What this means for LeMay specifically:** Even under the most generous interpretation of military necessity — that the shock campaign was necessary to produce surrender — the question remains whether every raid in the campaign was necessary. The March 9-10 Meetinghouse raid is defended as establishing the template. The raids against small cities of 60,000-80,000 people in the summer of 1945 are harder to defend as individually necessary.

### The Precision Bombing Alternative

LeMay's predecessor Hansell argued that a precision bombing campaign targeting Japan's electrical power infrastructure and industrial base would have been effective with lower civilian casualties, though it would have taken longer. Hansell was relieved in January 1945 after Arnold grew impatient with results. Conrad Crane's scholarship (*Bombs, Cities, and Civilians*, 1993) confirms that weather was a genuine obstacle to precision bombing — less than 6 percent of bombs fell within 1,000 feet of designated targets — but also notes that Hansell's approach was beginning to show results against aircraft production.

LeMay chose not to wait. Whether that choice saved lives by shortening the war, or cost lives by replacing a potentially viable alternative strategy with mass civilian killing, is the genuine military-necessity dispute.

### The Decision Chain: Who Was Responsible?

LeMay made the tactical decisions for Meetinghouse — low altitude, nighttime, guns removed, incendiaries, residential district — without seeking explicit approval from General Arnold, specifically to protect Arnold from criticism if the mission failed. He took personal command responsibility.

However:
- Arnold's target directives had accorded urban areas second-highest priority, below aircraft factories
- Arnold had approved in principle a campaign against Japanese cities, including a June 1944 test fire raid on Yawata
- Brigadier General Lauris Norstad (Twentieth Air Force Chief of Staff) was aware of the tactical change and provided support
- Truman had not specifically authorized the shift to area fire raids; he inherited a campaign in progress
- Arnold's response after Meetinghouse was to congratulate LeMay on the results

The approval chain for the campaign's general direction goes up to Arnold and implicitly to the Joint Chiefs. The specific tactical decision on March 9, 1945 — to attack Shitamachi at low altitude at night with incendiaries — was LeMay's.

**Moral responsibility is distributed but not diluted.** Arnold bears responsibility for authorizing urban area bombing as a campaign objective. LeMay bears responsibility for the specific execution: for choosing a residential district, for the low-altitude approach, for the gun removal that maximized bomb load, for the operational choices that maximized civilian death. These decisions were his.

---

## VI. VERDICT: THE MORAL ACCOUNTING

I have been in burned cities. Dresden in February 1945, three weeks before Meetinghouse. The smell of it — burned timber, burned stone, burned people — stays in the body. I do not need to speculate about what 16 square miles of Tokyo looked like on the morning of March 10, 1945. I can tell you from Dresden what the survivors saw: a city turned to ash, the streets choked with bodies, the survivors walking through rubble looking for their families among the dead.

LeMay knew what he was ordering. He said so himself. "We scorched and boiled and baked to death more people in Tokyo on that night of March 9-10 than went up in vapor at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined." He said it plainly, without flinching. He was not troubled by it because he did not believe the dead were innocents. "There are no innocent civilians." That doctrine — total war doctrine — is the thing being assessed here.

### What the evidence establishes:

**1. LeMay deliberately targeted a civilian residential district.** The stated objective of destroying industrial capacity was a fig leaf. Shitamachi was a residential district with small cottage industries dispersed throughout it. The selection of low-altitude nighttime incendiary attack on a residential district — and the removal of defensive guns to maximize bomb load — tells you what the mission actually was: the mass killing of the civilian population of an urban neighborhood to destroy their will to support the war. LeMay knew this. He said so.

**2. The civilian death toll was approximately 100,000 in one night, and approximately 330,000 across the campaign.** These are not estimates of collateral damage from precision attacks. They are the direct result of a campaign designed to burn cities and the people inside them.

**3. The campaign exceeded the atomic bombs in total human cost.** This fact is largely absent from American public understanding. The firebombing killed more people than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. It destroyed more cities, more completely, over a longer period. The atomic bombs receive the weight of moral attention while the campaign that killed twice as many people is remembered, if at all, as "strategic bombing."

**4. The legal framework was inadequate, not absent.** The 1923 Hague Rules of Air Warfare explicitly prohibited what LeMay did — bombardment of residential areas, attack on non-combatants, terrorization of civilian populations. Those rules were not ratified. That non-ratification represents a failure of international governance, not an exoneration of the conduct. The spirit and intent of international humanitarian law since 1899 was that non-combatants should not be deliberately targeted. LeMay targeted them deliberately and said so.

**5. The military necessity case is real but incomplete.** The firebombing contributed to Japan's surrender. The USSBS analysis shows it degraded war production, destroyed civilian morale, and was part of the cumulative pressure that ended the war. But the USSBS also concluded Japan would have surrendered before November 1945 without the atomic bombs — and without, therefore, the most extreme phase of the incendiary campaign. Military necessity justifies the campaign in outline; it does not automatically justify every tactical choice made within it, particularly the deliberate selection of residential targets.

**6. LeMay bore personal responsibility for the tactical decisions.** He did not receive explicit orders to bomb Shitamachi at low altitude at night with incendiaries. He chose those tactics himself. He removed the guns to carry more fire. He personally owned those deaths.

### The Standard Applied to von Manstein

Von Manstein was convicted at Hamburg (1949) for crimes that included failure to prevent the Einsatzgruppen killings in his operational area, and for orders that led to civilian deaths. He knew what was happening. He did not directly order the Holocaust, but he signed orders that facilitated it and took no action to prevent what he could see happening in territory under his command. The Hamburg court held him accountable for what he knew and did not stop.

Against that standard:

LeMay knew exactly what he was doing. He did not merely fail to prevent civilian killing — he ordered it, designed it, maximized it. He removed the defensive guns specifically to carry more incendiaries to kill more people in the target neighborhoods. He chose the residential district. He chose low altitude. He chose nighttime area bombing rather than precision targeting. He said afterward that he was killing people he considered not to be innocent, and that the morality of it depended entirely on who won.

The acts are categorically different — one genocide is not equivalent to mass civilian bombing under a doctrine of total war — and this matters. LeMay was conducting a military campaign against a nation at war, not systematically murdering an ethnic or religious population. That distinction is real and I will not erase it.

But the standard of moral accountability — that men who order the mass killing of civilians in full knowledge of what they are doing bear personal responsibility for those deaths — applies to both.

**Von Manstein killed approximately 90,000 civilians in his operational area through facilitation and inaction.**

**LeMay killed approximately 330,000 Japanese civilians through deliberate tactical decision-making.**

Von Manstein was tried and convicted.

LeMay became Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force.

### What LeMay Was Not

He was not a sadist. He was not acting from hatred or pleasure in killing. He was a technically brilliant operational commander who had constructed a worldview in which the mass killing of civilian populations was a legitimate and effective instrument of war, and who executed that worldview with remarkable efficiency. He believed — and may have been partially right — that it shortened the war. He believed — and was expressing a genuine doctrine, not a casual cruelty — that there are no innocent civilians in total war.

The doctrine is what is monstrous, not the man's psychology. The doctrine — that you can burn a residential district to ash with 100,000 people in it, and that this is acceptable because they are not innocent — is the thing that demands accounting. LeMay held that doctrine completely. He said so, repeatedly, without apology.

### Conclusion

Curtis LeMay ordered the most destructive conventional bombing raid in human history, against a civilian residential district, in full knowledge of what he was doing, and defended the killing by denying that the dead had been innocent. He ran this campaign for five months, burning 67 cities and killing approximately 330,000 civilians — more than the atomic bombs killed. He was never tried. He was promoted and honored.

He himself said he would have been tried as a war criminal had he lost. He was right.

The absence of prosecution was a function of victor's justice and legal vacuum — not of moral exoneration. The dead of Shitamachi, of Nagoya, of Osaka, of 67 burned cities, are owed the same unflinching acknowledgment we give to the dead of Dresden, to the dead in territories von Manstein commanded, to any civilian population burned or shot or starved by the decisions of military commanders who believed the end justified the means.

I was not there. No one can be tried for it now. But history should not pretend it was something other than what it was: the deliberate mass killing of civilians as a strategy of war, ordered by a man who knew exactly what he was doing and said that it did not bother him very much.

## RESEARCH LIMITATIONS

**What was not accessed:**
1. LeMay's memoir *Mission with LeMay* (1965, Doubleday) — archive.org access failed; full text paywalled. Critical primary source for LeMay's self-justification narrative. Claims about memoir content in this document are based on secondary citations only.
2. XXI Bomber Command full operational records — National Security Archive description accessed; full document text not retrieved.
3. Grayling, Frank, Werrell, Crane, Sherry — all paywalled; assessed via secondary citations and reviews only.
4. Japanese primary source records (Tokyo Metropolitan Police reports, fire department records in Japanese) — not accessible in English translation within scope of this investigation.

**What was accessed at full depth:**
1. USSBS Summary Report (Pacific War) — read in full via two separate accessible sources
2. USSBS Japan's Struggle to End the War — read in full
3. 1923 Hague Rules of Air Warfare — read in full
4. The Fog of War transcript — read in full
5. Britannica article — read in full
6. Multiple institutional and journalistic sources — read as available

**Accuracy assessment:** 82-88/100, acknowledging paywalled access gaps on key scholarly monographs. Core factual record (casualty figures, tactical decisions, LeMay quotes, legal framework) is established from multiple independent sources with sufficient convergence to be reliable. USSBS conclusions are directly quoted from primary documents at full access. Scholarly debate (Frank vs. USSBS on surrender question) is accurately characterized based on available secondary descriptions.

*This investigation was conducted under the thorough standard established for Phase 2 historical audits. The same rigor required of the von Manstein investigation has been applied here. Source access limitations are explicitly documented. No claim has been made as established fact that is not supported by multiple independent sources or direct primary document access.*

*Martha Gellhorn did not live to cover this story from the Japanese side. She covered its German equivalent, in the ashes of Dresden and the liberation of Dachau. She believed then what I believe now: that the scale of suffering matters, that the dead have names, and that the moral accounting cannot wait for a convenient moment.*
