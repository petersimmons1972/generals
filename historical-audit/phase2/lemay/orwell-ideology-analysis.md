## A Note on Method

I am not a military historian. I have not flown a bomber, planned a raid, or sat in a war room weighing the lives of civilians against strategic objectives. I will comment anyway, because the questions raised by Curtis LeMay's career are not, in the end, technical questions. They are political questions dressed in the language of military necessity, and my only qualification for addressing them is an obstinate habit of asking what words actually mean.

The question I want to examine is this: LeMay did not merely bomb cities. He built a complete ideological system justifying the deliberate mass killing of civilian populations as the most humane form of war. That system has an internal logic. It has supporting evidence. It has contradictions. And it was embraced, rewarded, and propagated by a democratic nation that simultaneously prosecuted Axis commanders for doing, in some cases, exactly the same thing.

I have read what is publicly accessible — the US Strategic Bombing Survey, contemporary news records, declassified National Security Archive documents, academic analysis, and LeMay's own documented statements. I have acknowledged where sources are paywalled. I will not overclaim.

## 1. The Strategic Bombing Doctrine: Internal Logic and Contradictions

### i. The Doctrine Stated

LeMay did not invent area bombing. Arthur Harris of RAF Bomber Command had been burning German cities for three years before LeMay applied incendiary tactics to Japan at scale. But LeMay articulated the doctrine more completely and more honestly than almost anyone else who practiced it. Strip away the military jargon and his argument runs as follows:

Modern war is not fought between armies. It is fought between industrial systems, and those industrial systems are embedded in populations. To destroy an enemy's capacity to fight, you must destroy the industrial base. The industrial base is in the cities. The cities are full of people who work in the factories, who feed the soldiers, who elect the governments, who constitute the enemy as a functioning system. Therefore, killing those people — or sufficiently terrorizing them — is not a war crime. It is strategy. And since a quick, overwhelming destruction of that system ends the war faster than a grinding attrition, mass killing is, paradoxically, humane. It saves more lives than it takes. The general who flinches from necessary destruction prolongs the war and kills more people than the general who applies maximum force immediately.

LeMay stated this position plainly and repeatedly. "If you kill enough of them, they stop fighting." (Documented statement, cited in *Strategic Air Warfare*, Kohn and Harahan, 1988.) "I'll tell you what war is about. You've got to kill people, and when you've killed enough they stop fighting." "It's more immoral to use less force than necessary, than it is to use more — if you use less force, you kill off more of humanity in the long run, because you are merely protracting the struggle."

This argument has a name in philosophy. It is a utilitarian argument. It counts deaths on both sides of a ledger and claims the column favoring maximum force shows a smaller total. It is also the argument that every commander who has ever ordered atrocities has made, from Sherman burning Georgia to the Luftwaffe bombing Rotterdam. That this fact does not automatically discredit the argument does not mean the argument is sound. It means the argument requires careful examination of its evidence.

### ii. The Evidence LeMay Used

LeMay's primary evidence for his doctrine was, appropriately, Japan itself.

The incendiary campaign against Japanese cities, launched at scale with Operation Meetinghouse on the night of March 9-10, 1945, was by any measure a military catastrophe for Japan. More than 90,000 and possibly more than 110,000 people were killed in a single night — the most destructive air attack in history, exceeding the immediate death toll of either atomic bomb. Sixteen square miles of Tokyo were reduced to ash. One million people were made homeless. The raid required 279 B-29s flying at low altitude (5,000 to 9,000 feet, stripped of defensive guns to carry more incendiaries), and it worked in a purely operational sense with terrible efficiency.

By July 1945, the US Strategic Bombing Survey concluded, Japan's industrial output had fallen to approximately 40% of its 1944 peak levels. Oil refineries had been reduced by 83%. Aircraft engine plants by 75%. Civilian morale had collapsed. The USSBS estimated total Japanese civilian casualties at approximately 806,000, of whom 330,000 died — a figure that "probably exceeded Japan's combat casualties" during the entire war. (US Strategic Bombing Survey: Summary Report, Pacific War, 1946.)

LeMay could, and did, point to these numbers as vindication. Japan surrendered. A land invasion of the Japanese home islands, projected to cost an estimated one million American casualties, did not occur. The argument appears to close itself.

### iii. The Evidence LeMay Ignored

There are four major problems with the doctrine as LeMay articulated it, and a thorough analysis requires stating all four.

**Problem one: Germany.** LeMay's doctrine was not developed in a vacuum. The British and Americans had been bombing Germany since 1940. By the time LeMay took command in the Pacific, the evidence from Europe was available. What did it show?

The US Strategic Bombing Survey's European report found that Allied bombing of Germany, while ultimately contributing to German defeat, did not produce the results the doctrine predicted. German armaments production under Albert Speer actually increased dramatically through 1944 — from roughly 1942 to late 1944, German war production tripled despite sustained bombing. Speer estimated losses from bombing at 20-30% of possible production, a significant figure, but not the collapse the theory predicted. The USSBS European report concluded that decisive strategic impact came not from bombing cities or factories, but from attacking oil supplies and transportation infrastructure — precisely the form of targeting that area bombing of population centers diluted resources away from. The blunt conclusion of the European survey: "area raids on cities did not substantially affect the course of German war production" in 1943-1944.

More important still: the German civilian response to bombing did not match the doctrine's prediction. The Blitz against Britain in 1940-41 had stiffened British civilian morale rather than breaking it. The same effect was documented in Germany. The USSBS found that German morale deteriorated under bombing, but that "there was a wide difference between dissatisfaction and expressed opposition" in a totalitarian system — workers continued producing under police-state compulsion even when personally demoralized. Bombing German civilians did not stop German war production in the way the doctrine required.

LeMay was aware of this evidence. He chose not to let it complicate his doctrine. He adapted it instead: Japan, he argued, was different. Japanese industrial production was concentrated in wooden cities; precision bombing was ineffective against dispersed cottage industries; low-altitude incendiary raids addressed these specific conditions. There is partial truth in this — Japanese construction methods did make incendiary weapons more destructive than high explosives, and the USSBS Pacific report found bombing more decisive in Japan than in Germany. But the doctrine LeMay articulated was not conditional. He did not say "bomb cities when the specific industrial geography makes it effective." He said "kill enough of them and they stop fighting." The Japanese case was used to validate a universal claim that the German case actively contradicted.

**Problem two: the surrender factors.** The USSBS Pacific report concluded that "certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated" — assuming conventional bombing continued. This is a remarkable finding, since it suggests the doctrine worked. But the same report identified the primary mechanism of Japan's economic collapse as the naval blockade cutting off imports of oil, bauxite, food, and raw materials — not the urban firebombing. Japan was an island nation dependent on imported resources. The blockade was strangling it. The bombing of cities accelerated an already-occurring collapse.

This matters for the doctrine because LeMay's claim was specifically that bombing civilian populations forces surrender. The USSBS evidence suggests, more precisely, that blockade-induced economic collapse forces surrender, and that bombing cities causes enormous human suffering while reinforcing and accelerating a process already underway through other means. These are not the same claim.

**Problem three: the moral economy.** LeMay's utilitarian calculus — that killing now saves lives later — requires trusting the estimate of lives saved. The projected one million American casualties from the invasion of Japan is a figure that has been examined closely by historians and found to be a planning estimate under specific worst-case assumptions, not a reliable prediction. The invasion would have been devastating; the actual casualty figure was genuinely unknowable in advance. LeMay's argument takes the highest possible projection of lives saved and divides it by the actual lives taken to produce a favorable ratio. This is not analysis. It is motivated arithmetic.

**Problem four: the alternatives not considered.** LeMay's operational reports and later statements consistently treat low-altitude incendiary area bombing as if it were the only available option once Japan refused to negotiate. It was not. The USSBS itself suggested that a focused attack on Japan's railroad and transportation system would have applied "maximum pressure" more efficiently than individual city and factory destruction. Precision attacks on the Japanese oil and transportation infrastructure — the strategy that worked better in Europe — were not pursued with the same intensity as urban firebombing. LeMay's tactical preference for the most destructive method available was not forced by strategic necessity. It was a choice.

### iv. The Evolution: From Europe to Japan

LeMay served in Europe before taking command in the Pacific. He led the 305th Bombardment Group in precision daylight raids against German targets, developing the combat box formation that improved accuracy and crew protection. He was, in the European theater, a precision bombing advocate operating within the doctrine that strategic bombing should target military and industrial facilities.

His shift to area firebombing in Japan represents not a changed doctrine but a revealed preference. In Europe, the constraints of precision doctrine were maintained because the US Army Air Forces' public justification for bombing — distinguishing itself from the British RAF's area bombing — required at least nominal targeting of industrial facilities. In Japan, where the targets were wooden cities housing dispersed industrial production and where the Japanese enemy was, in American military culture, regarded with different assumptions than the German enemy, those constraints loosened. LeMay stripped his B-29s of defensive guns, flew at low altitude, and burned cities. He did it on his own authority, timing the notification of his superiors (General Hap Arnold and Brigadier General Lauris Norstad) for a day he knew they would be absent — not to deceive them, as the evidence suggests Arnold broadly endorsed the shift, but to protect Arnold from responsibility if the attack failed.

This pattern — the doctrine is humanitarian in public, and the operational preference is for maximum destruction in practice — is not unique to LeMay. It is the structural logic of strategic bombing ideology itself.

## 2. SAC and Nuclear Ideology: Documented Positions

### i. What LeMay Built

Between 1948 and 1957, LeMay transformed Strategic Air Command from a demoralized post-war organization into what he and his admirers described as the most powerful military force in history. The organizational achievement is real and documented: SAC grew from 49,589 personnel with 713 aircraft in 1948 to 200,000 personnel and 3,068 aircraft by 1955, primarily jet bombers. Radar bomb scoring runs increased from 888 annually in 1946 to 43,722 by 1950. The "Peace is our Profession" motto was adopted — a phrase combining either deep irony or remarkable self-awareness, depending on how generously you read it.

The ideology LeMay built into SAC was not deterrence in the sense that most people now use that word. LeMay did not build SAC to prevent nuclear war through mutual assured destruction. He built SAC to win a nuclear war through preemptive destruction of the Soviet Union's ability to retaliate. The distinction matters enormously.

### ii. The Nuclear First-Strike Position

The documents are now partially declassified, and they are clarifying.

The SAC Atomic Weapons Requirements Study for 1959, an 800-page document whose existence was confirmed by the National Security Archive's declassification work, identified over 1,200 Soviet-bloc cities for "systematic destruction." Moscow had 180 designated ground zeros. Leningrad had 145. East Berlin had 91. Warsaw and Beijing were included. The targeting categories explicitly included "population" targets — not industrial facilities or military installations, but people themselves. The plan would have deployed thermonuclear weapons ranging from 1.7 to 10 megatons. LeMay requested a 60-megaton weapon. One megaton equals 70 times the explosive yield of the Hiroshima bomb.

LeMay's public statements during this period maintained formal compliance with the declared US policy of deterrence. But the classified record and his documented private statements tell a different story. In a 1956 speech to the National War College, LeMay stated: "Between sunset tonight and sunrise tomorrow morning the Soviet Union would likely cease to be a major military power or even a major nation." This was not deterrence language. This was first-strike planning language.

The Conversation's 2015 analysis of the period concluded that LeMay "ran his own agenda in the 1950s of trying to provoke the Soviet Union into nuclear confrontation" — and that this represented "one of his few failures." The evidence suggests LeMay made several unauthorized reconnaissance overflights of Soviet territory during the early 1950s, deliberately provoking Soviet air defenses, apparently in hopes of generating a confrontation that would justify preemptive action. This is not the behavior of a man who believed deterrence was the goal. This is the behavior of a man who believed war was inevitable and winning required striking first.

In July 1961, at a National Security Council meeting, the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented President Kennedy with plans for a preemptive nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, premised on "a surprise attack in late 1963, preceded by a period of heightened tensions." The US at this point possessed 185 ICBMs and over 3,400 deliverable nuclear weapons against only four identified Soviet ICBMs. LeMay, as Air Force Chief of Staff, was among those who advocated for exploiting this window. Kennedy questioned the assessments and requested answers in private.

### iii. The "Massive Retaliation" Doctrine

The Eisenhower administration's "massive retaliation" doctrine — announced by Secretary of State Dulles in January 1954, stating that any Soviet aggression would be met with immediate and massive nuclear response — is often associated with LeMay's SAC. The relationship is more complicated than it appears.

LeMay did not write "massive retaliation." He built the capability that made it plausible. SAC under LeMay provided Eisenhower with a credible threat of immediate nuclear retaliation, which Eisenhower used as a cheaper alternative to large conventional forces. LeMay's own view went further than the declared doctrine: he believed nuclear weapons should be used not just in response to Soviet aggression, but preemptively, before Soviet nuclear capability matured to the point of deterring American action. "Massive retaliation" as public doctrine meant "we will respond with nuclear weapons if attacked." LeMay's private position meant "we should attack before they can attack us."

The gap between the public doctrine and LeMay's private views represents a structural tension in American nuclear strategy throughout the 1950s: civilian leadership wanted deterrence, military planning assumed war-fighting, and the two assumptions are mutually contradictory.

### iv. The Cuban Missile Crisis: The Documented Record

In October 1962, when Soviet missiles were discovered in Cuba, LeMay was Air Force Chief of Staff and sat on the Executive Committee (ExComm) advising President Kennedy. His position was documented in ExComm discussions and subsequently confirmed in retrospective accounts.

LeMay advocated for immediate military action: bombing of the Cuban missile sites, followed by a sustained campaign, followed by invasion. He called Kennedy's chosen response — a naval blockade — "almost as bad as the appeasement at Munich" and "the greatest defeat in our history." He stated his conviction that a US military attack on Cuba would not provoke any Soviet military response — an assessment that, given what we now know about the presence of Soviet tactical nuclear weapons in Cuba and the authority their commanders had to use them, represents either a catastrophic intelligence failure or a catastrophic analytical failure on LeMay's part.

The Cuban Missile Crisis is the clearest single illustration of what LeMay's nuclear ideology would have produced in practice. Kennedy's restraint prevented a nuclear exchange that, as subsequent evidence has confirmed, was genuinely possible. LeMay's preferred course of action would, according to the most credible post-Cold War scholarship, have had a substantial probability of triggering exactly the nuclear war he claimed SAC existed to prevent.

## 3. Language Analysis: How LeMay Talked About Mass Killing

### i. The Pattern

There are four distinct registers in LeMay's public language about mass killing, and examining them together reveals something more interesting than simple callousness. LeMay was not a man who didn't think about what he was doing. He was a man who had thought about it very carefully, constructed a complete justification, and then stated that justification in deliberately stripped-down language that refused euphemism.

This is unusual. Most commanders who order the killing of civilians retreat into the passive voice and institutional abstraction. McNamara later spent decades in public guilt. Harris refused to discuss Dresden. LeMay looked at what he had done and said it plainly. The effect is paradoxically more disturbing than evasion.

### ii. The Language of Civilians

On civilian casualties from firebombing:

"There are no innocent civilians. It is their government and you are fighting a people, you are not trying to fight an armed force anymore. So it doesn't bother me so much to be killing the so-called innocent bystanders." (Documented, multiple sources)

"We knew we were going to kill a lot of women and kids when we burned that town." (On Tokyo, documented in multiple retrospective accounts)

"Killing Japanese didn't bother me very much at that time." (LeMay, in *Mission with LeMay*, 1965, or associated interviews — frequently cited)

Three features of this language are worth notation.

First, the elimination of the category of the innocent. "There are no innocent civilians" is not a tactical judgment but an ontological one. It collapses the distinction between a person and their government, treating the governed as fully responsible for the actions of those governing them. This is the same argument that authoritarian governments use when punishing populations for resistance. It is interesting that a general defending American democracy employed it.

Second, the admission of prior knowledge. "We knew we were going to kill a lot of women and kids" is a remarkable statement. It does not claim the civilian deaths were unintended collateral damage. It asserts that the killing of women and children was anticipated, accepted, and incorporated into operational planning. This is not the language of incidental civilian harm. This is the language of deliberate civilian targeting.

Third, the peculiar emotional flatness. "It doesn't bother me" and "didn't bother me very much at that time" are not boasts. They are more unsettling than boasts would be. They suggest a carefully maintained emotional distance — the "emotional distance" that LeMay's biographers note enabled him to make decisions that others avoided. The flatness is itself a kind of rhetoric: it signals that the speaker has thought past the emotion that would give other people pause, and arrived at a cold clarity that ordinary people cannot access. It is the language of a man who regards his own emotional detachment as a professional qualification.

### iii. The Language of Nuclear Weapons

LeMay's language on nuclear weapons is one of deliberate normalization. The strategy was consistent: he portrayed public fear of nuclear weapons as irrational, manufactured, and propagandistically induced.

"We seem to have a phobia about nuclear weapons. I think to most military men that a nuclear weapon is just another weapon in our arsenal." (1968 press conference, documented in multiple sources)

"I don't believe the world will end if we explode a nuclear weapon." (Same press conference)

"If I found it necessary, I would use anything we could dream up — including nuclear weapons." (On Vietnam, same press conference)

In his 1956 National War College speech: "Between sunset tonight and sunrise tomorrow morning the Soviet Union would likely cease to be a major military power or even a major nation."

The word "phobia" is doing precise work here. A phobia is an irrational fear — a psychological disorder, a distortion of reality. To describe public concern about nuclear weapons as a "phobia" is to diagnose popular democratic opinion as pathological. The people who fear nuclear weapons are not reacting to a genuine threat; they have been manipulated into an unreasonable emotional response. The military professionals who regard nuclear weapons as "just another" tool are the rational ones, unclouded by propaganda.

This framing served a specific ideological function. If nuclear anxiety is a phobia induced by enemy propaganda, then democratic civilian control of nuclear weapons policy is itself suspect — it operates on distorted popular emotion rather than the clear-eyed calculations of professionals. LeMay's language consistently positioned military commanders as the competent authorities on nuclear matters, and democratic public opinion as an obstacle to rational policy.

The "just another weapon" formulation also erases the category difference that distinguishes thermonuclear weapons from other arms. A 10-megaton warhead is not "just another weapon" in the sense that a carbine and an artillery shell are both weapons. It is a weapon whose use against a Soviet city would release radiation killing people in ways that cannot be targeted, cannot be stopped at a border, and cannot be constrained to combatants. LeMay's language refuses to acknowledge this distinction — not because he was ignorant of it, but because acknowledging it would complicate his operational planning.

### iv. The Language of the Soviet Union

LeMay's public statements about the Soviet Union are notable for what they do not contain. Unlike Senator McCarthy's contemporaries, LeMay rarely engaged in the ideological language of communism-as-satanic-infection. He was not, primarily, an ideological anti-communist in the rhetorical sense. His statements about the Soviet Union are military assessments and threat analyses: Soviet strategic capability, Soviet nuclear development, Soviet military intentions.

What LeMay consistently expressed about the Soviet Union was a belief in its aggressive inevitability. The Soviet Union, in LeMay's framework, would attack when it was capable of doing so. This was not a political assessment subject to diplomatic revision; it was a military fact to be planned around. This framing had a crucial implication: since Soviet attack was a matter of military capacity rather than political choice, diplomacy and negotiation were irrelevant. The only relevant variable was American military superiority. The only relevant policy question was whether to strike first.

This is a worldview that makes arms control impossible in principle, and LeMay explicitly rejected it: he "maintained absolutely no confidence in arms control agreements." If Soviet aggressiveness is a military constant rather than a political variable, then no agreement signed by the Soviet government changes the underlying reality.

### v. The Language of Vietnam

The "Stone Age" formulation deserves careful examination, because LeMay himself disputed the attribution.

The phrase "bomb them back to the Stone Age" became attached to LeMay through his 1965 book *Mission with LeMay*, written with MacKinlay Kantor. In a 1968 Washington Post interview, LeMay stated: "I never said we should bomb them back to the Stone Age. I said we had the capability to do it." This is an interesting distinction. LeMay claimed he was describing capability, not advocating policy.

Even accepting this clarification — and there are reasons to be skeptical, since the formulation appears in the published book — what LeMay's 1968 press conference statements actually said is sufficient: "If I found it necessary, I would use anything we could dream up — including nuclear weapons." This is advocacy, not capability description.

The Vietnam language is continuous with everything else in LeMay's rhetorical system. The enemy is an industrial-social system. Sufficient destruction of that system compels surrender. The means of destruction should be proportionate not to some external moral constraint, but to the military objective. The constraint LeMay consistently rejected was the political constraint of democratic civilian decision-making about the acceptable costs of war.

## 4. The 1968 Wallace Campaign: Ideology in Politics

### i. The Partnership

In October 1968, General Curtis LeMay (ret.) accepted George Wallace's offer to be the vice-presidential candidate of the American Independent Party. Wallace was a segregationist governor of Alabama who had stood in a schoolhouse door to block racial integration and who built his political career on the systematic degradation and violent suppression of Black Americans. LeMay was a retired four-star general whose stated military views — preemptive nuclear war, civilian bombing as strategy, nuclear weapons as just another tool — placed him outside the American political mainstream.

The pairing of Wallace and LeMay is worth analyzing as an ideological statement, not just a political accident. Wallace represented the politics of racial hierarchy within the United States; LeMay represented the politics of unrestrained military force abroad. Both were, in different registers, expressions of the belief that certain categories of human being deserve less moral consideration — that populations can be managed, suppressed, or destroyed without the constraints that normally govern democratic societies.

I want to be careful here about overclaiming. LeMay's documented statements do not include racist content. He was not a Wallace ally on racial politics. His motivation for joining the ticket appears to have been political opportunity and his genuine belief that American restraint in Vietnam was producing unnecessary casualties. He was not a segregationist. But the partnership represents a convergence of two forms of contempt for democratic constraint: Wallace's contempt for civil rights law, and LeMay's contempt for civilian control of military force.

### ii. The Press Conference Disaster

The AIP ticket was announced on October 3, 1968, at a press conference that became immediately disastrous and remains historically instructive.

LeMay arrived at the press conference and stated his views on nuclear weapons without apparent awareness that those views were going to destroy the campaign. When reporters pressed him on Vietnam and nuclear weapons, he said: "We seem to have a phobia about nuclear weapons. I think to most military men that a nuclear weapon is just another weapon in our arsenal." He stated he would use "anything we could dream up — including nuclear weapons" if he found it necessary. He said he did not "believe the world will end if we explode a nuclear weapon."

Wallace attempted damage control in real time, repeatedly interjecting to say LeMay had not advocated nuclear weapons use. LeMay ignored these interjections and restated his position. The spectacle — a presidential candidate frantically trying to suppress his running mate's statements as the running mate continued making them — was a public demonstration of exactly the relationship between civilian authority and military judgment that LeMay had spent his career embodying. He did not believe civilian political judgment took precedence over military assessment. He was not going to pretend otherwise for George Wallace's convenience.

The campaign did not recover. Wallace had been polling in the low 20s before the press conference, a credible showing for a third-party candidate. His numbers collapsed in October, and historians attribute a significant portion of that collapse to the "LeMay fiasco." The voters who abandoned Wallace after LeMay's press conference were not, presumably, people who had previously considered nuclear weapons acceptable. They were voters who had convinced themselves that Wallace could be supported as a protest vote while remaining within the bounds of normal political risk. LeMay's statements removed that comfortable self-deception.

### iii. The Ideological Continuity

What LeMay said at the 1968 press conference was exactly what he had believed and said, in less public forums, for twenty years. The ideology of nuclear weapons as just another weapon, of public fear as a manufactured phobia, of military necessity as the ultimate trump card against democratic hesitation — this was the same ideology that had built SAC, that had planned for pre-emptive Soviet destruction, that had argued against Kennedy's blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The 1968 campaign is interesting not because LeMay said something new but because he said what he had always believed to an audience that had not previously been required to absorb it directly. The political class had been able to contain LeMay's views within the classified apparatus of nuclear planning. On October 3, 1968, at a campaign press conference, those views escaped containment. The democratic public — the people LeMay had consistently treated as an obstacle to rational military policy — rejected them.

LeMay's failure to grasp why his nuclear statements were politically catastrophic is its own commentary on his ideology. He genuinely did not understand why ordinary people feared nuclear weapons. He thought they were wrong. He thought they were misinformed. It did not occur to him that a democratic public might have legitimate standing to make judgments about the weapons used in their name — that the public fear he dismissed as a "phobia" might be a rational response to the actual danger, and that the "clear-eyed" military professionals who wanted to use nuclear weapons freely might be the parties exhibiting a distorted relationship to reality.

## 5. The Double Standard: Structural Analysis

### i. The Question

Curtis LeMay supervised the killing of more civilians in a shorter period than any other American military commander in history. The Tokyo firebombing of March 9-10, 1945, killed between 90,000 and 110,000 people in a single night, the majority of them civilians. The broader incendiary campaign against Japanese cities from March to August 1945 killed hundreds of thousands more. The US Strategic Bombing Survey estimated total Japanese civilian casualties at approximately 806,000, with 330,000 dead.

LeMay knew what he was doing. He acknowledged it: "We knew we were going to kill a lot of women and kids when we burned that town." He anticipated criminal prosecution: "If we'd lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals." Robert McNamara, who served under LeMay during the bombing campaign, agreed: "LeMay said if we'd lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals. And I think he's right."

Instead of prosecution, LeMay received promotion. He became Commander of Strategic Air Command, Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. Japan, the nation whose civilians he had burned in their hundreds of thousands, awarded him the First Class Order of the Rising Sun in 1964. He died in 1990 at age 83, in a hospital at March Air Force Base, honored and unaccountable.

At Nuremberg, German commanders were prosecuted and executed for the deliberate killing of civilians.

The question is why.

### ii. The Formal Legal Argument

The formal legal distinction between what LeMay did and what Axis commanders were prosecuted for runs as follows:

The 1907 Hague Regulations prohibited attacks on undefended towns. They did not contain explicit provisions on aerial bombing because heavier-than-air flight did not exist in practical form when the Regulations were written. The 1923 Hague Rules of Air Warfare, drafted to address this gap, were never formally ratified by any major power. The Nuremberg tribunals applied the principle of "crimes against humanity" and "war crimes" as understood by the tribunal's judges — judges who were representatives of the victorious Allied powers.

The Tokyo Tribunal, which prosecuted Japanese military and political leaders, included the remarkable dissent of Indian Justice Radhabinod Pal, who argued that the Tribunal failed to provide anything other than "the victors' opportunity to retaliate against the losers." Pal noted the asymmetry explicitly: the tribunal was prepared to prosecute Japanese commanders for attacks on civilian populations while leaving entirely unexamined the Allied firebombing campaigns that had killed far more Japanese civilians than Japanese military action had killed any comparable population.

The US government's own State Department had, in 1937-1938, protested Japanese bombing of Chinese cities as "unwarranted and contrary to principles of law and of humanity." British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain stated in 1938 that bombing of civilian populations was "an undoubted violation of international law." The League of Nations had unanimously passed a resolution affirming the illegality of deliberate targeting of civilian populations. The Allied powers were fully aware that targeting civilian populations was considered illegal; they had said so themselves when the Japanese did it.

The formal legal argument for why LeMay was not prosecuted essentially reduces to: the law of aerial warfare was ambiguous, the victors defined what constituted war crimes at the post-war tribunals, and the victors defined it in ways that excluded their own conduct. This is not a legal defense of LeMay's actions as legal; it is an explanation of why legal proceedings did not occur. The two things are distinct.

### iii. The Structural Reasons

There are four structural reasons why LeMay's firebombing was categorized as military achievement rather than war crimes, and they have nothing to do with the actual moral or legal character of the acts.

**First: victors write the law.** The post-war tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo were institutions of the victorious Allied powers. Their jurisdiction was entirely dependent on the fact of Allied military victory. The crimes they prosecuted were real crimes — the Holocaust, the Rape of Nanking, slave labor, aggressive war. But the definition of which acts constituted prosecutable war crimes was determined by the prosecuting powers, and those powers excluded their own analogous acts from prosecution. This is not a new observation; Justice Pal noted it in 1946. It is simply a structural reality of international law in the mid-20th century: there was no neutral authority to apply it symmetrically.

**Second: the national narrative required it.** American participation in World War II was justified, publicly, as a war of liberation against fascist aggression. That narrative required that American military conduct be categorically distinct from Axis conduct. The Tokyo firebombing, the Dresden bombing, the broader area bombing campaigns could not be integrated into the narrative of American moral superiority without destroying the narrative itself. They were therefore not integrated. They were categorized differently — as military necessity, as responses to enemy conduct, as regrettable but unavoidable — through a process of rhetorical management that LeMay himself occasionally punctured with his habitual directness.

**Third: bombing occupies a different moral category in Western culture.** There is a persistent, largely unexamined assumption in Western military thinking that killing at a distance is morally different from killing at close range. The extermination of civilians by German Einsatzgruppen on the Eastern Front — men with guns shooting women and children at the edge of ditches — strikes ordinary moral intuition as obviously criminal. The burning of civilians in Tokyo by B-29s flying at 9,000 feet involves the same dead civilians, but the physical distance and technological intermediation create a moral distancing that our intuitions do not penetrate as easily. LeMay was not looking through a rifle sight at identifiable human beings; he was reading bomb damage assessment reports. The mechanism of killing affects our moral response to it, without any logical reason why it should.

**Fourth: strategic bombing was categorized as industrial targeting even when it was not.** The public language surrounding the bombing campaigns — precision bombing, industrial targets, military objectives — maintained a nominal distinction between targeting the enemy's productive capacity and targeting enemy civilians, even when the actual operations did not maintain this distinction. LeMay's own statements ("there are no innocent civilians") were made in retrospect, after the war, when prosecution was no longer possible. During the war, the public language of strategic bombing preserved the fiction that civilians were the incidental rather than the deliberate objects of attack. This fiction did crucial ideological work: it allowed democratic publics to support the bombing campaigns without confronting the full moral weight of what those campaigns entailed.

### iv. What the Double Standard Reveals

The double standard does not reveal that LeMay was innocent. It does not reveal that the Axis commanders were not guilty of genuine war crimes; they were. What it reveals is that the category "war crime" is not a pure moral category. It is a political category — one that powerful states apply to their enemies and withhold from their own commanders, and one whose application depends not on the nature of the act but on the identity of the actor and the outcome of the war.

Arthur Harris, LeMay's British counterpart, was treated differently within this double standard. While not prosecuted, Harris was conspicuously denied honors that comparable British commanders received; he was not made a peer, while other wartime commanders were. The British political class recognized, without stating explicitly, that Harris's conduct occupied a space too morally uncomfortable for full celebration. LeMay received no such ambivalence. He was celebrated, promoted, and given high office. The difference may reflect the difference between burning German cities — whose civilian inhabitants were European and whose suffering generated at least some moral discomfort among postwar commentators — and burning Japanese cities, where racist assumptions about the enemy had been cultivated throughout the war.

LeMay himself understood the double standard with perfect clarity. "If we'd lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals." He did not conclude from this that he had, in fact, committed war crimes. He concluded that "war criminal" is a title given to losers. He was right about the political fact. Whether he was right about the moral one is a question the double standard was designed to prevent from being examined seriously.

## Conclusion: The System and Its Endurance

LeMay's ideology, stated plainly, is this: the purpose of military force is to destroy an enemy's will and capacity to resist; the fastest way to achieve this is to destroy enough of the enemy's population and infrastructure that continued resistance becomes impossible; democratic hesitation about mass killing is a sentimental obstruction to this rational calculation; and the commander who prosecutes war with maximum force is the most humane commander because he shortens the suffering.

This system is internally consistent. It has a logic. It even has, in the specific case of Japan in 1945, a body of supporting evidence — although, as I have argued, the evidence is more complicated and less conclusive than LeMay's retrospective certainty suggests.

What the system cannot account for is its own failure modes. It cannot account for the fact that terror bombing stiffened British and German civilian morale while failing to break Japanese civilian morale until economic collapse (driven primarily by blockade) made resistance materially impossible. It cannot account for the Cuban Missile Crisis, where LeMay's calculus that a US attack on Cuba would not provoke Soviet military response was almost certainly wrong. It cannot account for Vietnam, where maximum air power over a decade produced neither military victory nor political surrender. It cannot account for the fact that the one clear case supporting the doctrine — Japan's surrender in 1945 — involved a constellation of simultaneous factors (blockade, Soviet entry, atomic bombs, conventional firebombing) whose relative contribution remains contested.

The ideology endures not because it has been vindicated but because it serves a function. It gives military commanders a clean moral framework for ordering mass killing. It gives democratic governments a way to wage total war while maintaining that their hands are cleaner than their enemies'. It gives civilian populations a way to accept the killing done in their name without fully confronting its character.

"Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind." I wrote that in a different context. LeMay's language was not designed to deceive in the ordinary sense; he was usually brutally direct. But the ideology he served — the ideology that burning cities is strategy, that civilian deaths are military calculations, that nuclear weapons are just another tool — performs exactly this function. It makes murder respectable. It wraps the death of a hundred thousand people in a single night in the language of necessity, efficiency, and humanitarian restraint.

LeMay believed it. I think that is the most disturbing fact about him.
