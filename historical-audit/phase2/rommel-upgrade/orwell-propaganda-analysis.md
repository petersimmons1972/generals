## Preliminary Admission

I will admit my bias at once. I spent years watching political language do its work — in Burma, in Spain, in the Tribune columns. I know how a myth is built, not because I read about it, but because I watched it happen, sometimes from the inside. The Rommel mythology is not remarkable because it succeeded. It is remarkable because it succeeded three times, built by three separate parties for three mutually contradictory purposes, and none of them bothered to check whether it was true.

What follows is not a restatement of what Murrow has already verified. Murrow counted the bodies. I am examining the language used to explain them away.

## Part I: The Architecture of the Myth — Who Built It, When, and Why

The Rommel myth was not one myth. It was three myths, each built on the ruins of the previous, each serving a different master.

### Stage 1: The Nazi Construction (1941–1943)

The "Desert Fox" persona was not earned. It was manufactured.

In 1941, Goebbels's Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda needed a figure. The war in North Africa was going badly in the sense that it was going on at all — Hitler had never intended Africa as a major theatre, and the diversion of resources to support Mussolini was a strategic embarrassment. What Germany needed was a symbol of superiority, not a record of success. Rommel, who had shown genuine tactical speed in France in 1940 and who was now in the desert fighting the British, was available.

The construction was systematic. Rommel himself participated. He brought a personal cameraman — Leutnant Karl Ludwig Strauch — to the front. He staged footage. He cooperated with the propaganda apparatus because he understood, as a career officer, that visibility meant advancement. The newsreels showed a commander who moved with his troops, who appeared fearless, who stood in open vehicles in the desert sun. The image preceded the reality: by the time the myth of tactical genius had been established in German public consciousness, it was already impossible to evaluate Rommel's actual performance against any neutral standard.

The critical mechanism here is what I will call **manufacture by repetition**. Goebbels did not claim that Rommel was a genius and then prove it. He showed Rommel in action, described the action as genius, and repeated the description until the description became the fact. This is precisely what "Politics and the English Language" identified as the central function of political language: "to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind."

The nickname itself — "Desert Fox" — is worth a sentence. It originated in German propaganda usage (Wüstenfuchs) and was applied by Goebbels's apparatus to suggest cunning, adaptability, and predatory effectiveness. It is the language of admiration borrowed from the animal world, which removes the need for specific factual claims. You cannot argue with a metaphor. A fox is clever by definition. The label did the work that evidence was not needed to do.

**Who benefited:** Nazi propaganda ministry. Rommel himself, who received rapid promotion. Hitler, who could point to North Africa as a sideshow run by a genius rather than an expensive waste.

### Stage 2: The British Political Construction (1941–1942)

Here is the strangest feature of the Rommel myth: the British built it too.

On January 27, 1942, Winston Churchill rose in Parliament and said: "We have a very daring and skilful opponent against us and, may I say across the havoc of war, a great General."

This sentence requires examination. Churchill was not giving a military assessment. He was conducting a political operation.

By January 1942, the British position in North Africa was dire. Tobruk would fall in June. The 8th Army was being beaten repeatedly by a force it outnumbered. Churchill faced a genuine crisis of political legitimacy. The British public was demanding to know why their army kept losing to what appeared to be an inferior Axis force. There were two possible answers: (i) the British generals were incompetent, or (ii) the opponent was extraordinary. Churchill chose the second answer. It was easier to praise Rommel in Parliament than to sack Auchinleck, explain the systemic failures of British officer training, or acknowledge that the 8th Army's command structure was, as one internal assessment noted, "cumbersome and rigid."

The parliamentary praise accomplished several things simultaneously:

**(i) It neutralized domestic criticism.** If even Churchill admitted Rommel was a "great General," then losing to him was not a disgrace requiring accountability.

**(ii) It transferred agency.** British defeats stopped being a story about British failures and became a story about German excellence. The passive construction hides itself here — "driven back 500 miles" rather than "we retreated 500 miles because our command structure failed."

**(iii) It served Churchill personally.** A man who praises a worthy adversary appears magnanimous and clear-eyed. A man who loses to a mediocre opponent appears merely incompetent.

The sentence was also taken up by British dissenters for their own purposes. Left-wing critics of the British Army used Rommel's apparent success against British forces as evidence that class-bound British officer culture was failing the common soldier. The "Desert Fox" mythology thus served simultaneously the establishment (explaining away defeat) and its critics (demonstrating the establishment's failures). A myth that can be used by both sides of a political argument is a myth with unusual staying power.

**General Auchinleck, who understood the danger, issued a direct order:** "Stop altogether talking of Rommel." He recognized that mythologizing the enemy corroded the morale of his own troops. He was ignored. Churchill's parliamentary phrase had already done its work.

**Who benefited:** Churchill personally. British military establishment collectively. Left-wing critics of British Army class structure, paradoxically. The myth, once created, had no owner.

### Stage 3: The Cold War Construction (1945–1960s)

After Germany's defeat, the myth did not die. It mutated into something more durable and more politically useful.

The Western Allies in 1945–1950 faced a problem they had not anticipated: they needed to rearm West Germany. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, formed in 1949, required a German contribution to its military capacity. But West Germany's military tradition was stained by twelve years of National Socialism, by the Holocaust, by the crimes of the Wehrmacht in the east. You cannot ask a nation to provide soldiers for a new army without providing those soldiers with a tradition they can respect.

The solution was the Clean Wehrmacht myth: the assertion that the regular German armed forces had been a professional, apolitical institution, separate from the crimes of the SS and the Nazi party leadership. Individual soldiers — even individual generals — had simply been doing their duty. The political criminality was above them and beside them, not in them.

This myth was built through several interlocking mechanisms.

**The memoir offensive.** Former Wehrmacht officers wrote memoirs at a remarkable pace. Guderian published *Panzer Leader* in 1952. Manstein published *Lost Victories* in 1955. These memoirs uniformly presented their authors as professional soldiers operating within a corrupt system they could not control. The memoirs were self-serving in the obvious sense, but they were also self-reinforcing: each memoir cited other memoirs, and a body of "testimony" accrued that had the appearance of documentary evidence.

**The Adenauer bargain.** Konrad Adenauer's government required experienced military leadership for the new Bundeswehr. Former Wehrmacht officers were the only available source of that experience. Adenauer, according to documented accounts, "agreed to allow Wehrmacht veterans to reform their history in an effort to secure a new German military." This was not a secret arrangement. It was the political logic of the situation, stated plainly. The myth was the price of the deal.

**Allied acceptance.** Western Allied governments accepted the myth because it served their interests. The alternative — a thorough accounting of Wehrmacht participation in the crimes of the Third Reich — would have made German rearmament politically impossible at the moment it was strategically necessary. One analysis of this period put it plainly: the myth "suited the Allies just fine." This is an example of what I would call **institutional complicity by convenience** — not active conspiracy, but a shared interest in not looking too carefully at the evidence.

**The cultural products.** The 1951 film *The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel*, directed by Henry Hathaway and starring James Mason, arrived precisely at the moment when West German rearmament was being debated. The film portrayed Rommel as conspiring against Hitler — a "good German" who died resisting the regime he had served. One scholar notes the film "broke a taboo in West Germany," after which there was "a veritable avalanche of war films" in West German cinemas. The film did not argue for German rehabilitation. It demonstrated it, emotionally, in two hours, to mass audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.

**The Rommel Papers.** Published in 1953, edited by B.H. Liddell Hart, this collection gave the myth its scholarly apparatus. It required separate analysis, which follows in Part II.

---

## Part II: Liddell Hart — The Scholar as Myth-Maker

Of all the agents in the construction of the Rommel mythology, B.H. Liddell Hart is the most interesting, because he was a serious military thinker who corrupted his seriousness in the service of a vanity project.

Liddell Hart had spent decades developing and promoting what he called the "strategy of indirect approach" — a theory of warfare based on psychological dislocation, maneuver around the enemy's flank, and the avoidance of direct frontal engagement. It was a genuinely interesting theory. It was also, by the end of World War II, a theory in need of validation. Liddell Hart had been wrong about enough — he had advocated defensive strategy before the war and then watched Germany's offensive blitzkrieg demolish it — that he needed a posthumous witness.

Rommel was his witness.

The structure of the relationship is visible in the Rommel Papers themselves. Liddell Hart edited the papers, wrote the introduction, and shaped the narrative framing. In his introduction, he describes Rommel as exemplifying the indirect approach — as a commander who won through psychological dislocation and maneuver rather than brute force. This framing has two problems.

**(i) Rommel did not operate from theory.** Modern historians (Citino, Barr, Addington, Beckett) have consistently noted that Rommel's tactical intuition was genuine but strategically unguided. His solution to every tactical problem was to attack. This is not the indirect approach. This is the direct approach conducted at speed. Liddell Hart's framing required describing Rommel's characteristic frontal aggression as a sophisticated form of maneuver. It was not.

**(ii) Liddell Hart had interviewed captured German generals in 1945.** These interviews, published as *The Other Side of the Hill* (1948) and *The German Generals Talk* (1948), contain a pattern that one critic noted plainly: "Liddell Hart's post-war interviews of German generals include lots of quotes that he uses to support his claim that he invented Blitzkrieg." The generals said, in these interviews, that they had read Liddell Hart before the war and been influenced by him. Whether this was true, or whether they said it because Liddell Hart wanted to hear it, is a question the interviews themselves cannot answer. A biographer does not interrogate an interview subject about his agreement with the biographer.

**(iii) The statistical question Murrow raised.** Murrow's most important finding in the thorough standard review is this: the widely-cited France 1940 prisoner statistic — 97,648 prisoners captured — traces back to *The Rommel Papers* (Liddell Hart ed., 1953). It does not trace to an independently verified Allied source. The number that appears in every subsequent account originated with Rommel's own account, edited and published by the man who most needed Rommel to be a military genius. This is not fabrication. It may be perfectly accurate. But it is self-reporting laundered through the appearance of scholarly documentation.

The mechanism is precise: Liddell Hart's theoretical agenda required a general who validated the indirect approach. Rommel's family provided papers. Liddell Hart edited, framed, and published them with an introduction asserting that Rommel was exactly what Liddell Hart's theory predicted a great general would be. Subsequent historians quoted the Rommel Papers as a primary source. The source chain ran from Rommel's self-assessment through Liddell Hart's theoretical agenda to the scholarly literature, and nowhere in that chain was there an independent verification.

**The language Liddell Hart used is itself diagnostic.** His introduction describes Rommel as demonstrating "the higher combination of mental and physical qualities." The phrase "higher combination" is Latinate, abstract, and unfalsifiable. It cannot be tested against any evidence. A general who won demonstrates the "higher combination." A general who lost was perhaps undone by circumstances. The language is constructed to close off inquiry rather than open it.

---

## Part III: Language Analysis — The Specific Words That Did the Work

Political language is machinery. It processes raw events into acceptable conclusions. The Rommel mythology had a specific vocabulary, and each word in that vocabulary performed a specific function.

### "Chivalrous"

This is the most important word in the Rommel myth. It appears in nearly every popular account. It does significant political work.

"Chivalrous" is a medieval word applied to a mechanized desert war. It evokes knights, honor, codes of conduct, the noble adversary. It implies that Rommel's conduct toward his enemies followed a system of values that transcended the specific political context of National Socialism. A chivalrous man cannot be a Nazi ideologue, because chivalry belongs to a value system predating and superior to fascism.

The word's origin in this context appears to be British. British officers in North Africa, including figures in Auchinleck's staff, used the language of "chivalry" to describe the desert war before Churchill's parliamentary speech. The word was then incorporated into the parliamentary discourse and from there into the popular and scholarly record.

What the word "chivalrous" does not do: it does not cite evidence. It does not distinguish between not executing prisoners personally and not knowing that they were being executed by others. It does not address the question of what "chivalry" means to an Arab or Berber or Jewish civilian in the territory Rommel's forces occupied. Patrick Bernhard's research — which I will acknowledge I have accessed only in abstract, consistent with the thoroughness standard — documents systematic atrocities in North Africa involving "murder of prisoners, civilian plunder, sexual violence, and mass detention." The word "chivalrous" accomplishes what the abstract, statistical presentation of these atrocities cannot: it makes them unthinkable.

**Origin assessment:** Post-war construction, possibly partly organic during the war as a British officer class cultural reflex, but systematically deployed as part of the Cold War rehabilitation project.

**Function:** Insulates Rommel from the institutional context in which he operated. Makes further inquiry seem pedantic.

### "Apolitical"

This word is the central prop of the Clean Wehrmacht myth as applied to Rommel. It means: he was a soldier, not a politician. He served Germany, not Hitler. He followed orders in the professional tradition of the officer corps, not in the ideological submission of the Nazi party.

The historical record is direct on this question. Rommel was appointed liaison to the Hitler Youth in 1937. He wrote to his wife at the time: "The German Wehrmacht is the sword of the new German world view." He commanded Hitler's personal bodyguard in 1939 — a position held by a man in whom Hitler had specific personal trust. He cooperated with Goebbels's propaganda ministry throughout the African campaign. He received payments from Hitler's personal slush fund (Konto 5). He maintained close personal relations with Hitler through the period when the worst crimes of the regime were being committed.

The word "apolitical" requires that all of this be invisible. It requires that "serving the state" and "serving Hitler's ideology" be separated into two distinct categories, when the available evidence suggests Rommel did not experience them as separate. Reuth's assessment — that Rommel "had understood neither National Socialism, nor the resistance to it. Like millions of Germans he followed Hitler into disaster and whilst doing so he believed he was only doing his duty" — is the most honest single sentence in the scholarship. It does not vindicate Rommel. It does not condemn him as a committed Nazi. It locates him where the evidence places him: in the vast middle of ordinary complicity, following the leader he had pledged to serve.

The word "apolitical" cannot survive contact with this description.

**Origin assessment:** Post-war construction. The word did not appear in contemporary German accounts of Rommel. It is a retrospective application designed to distinguish Rommel (and by extension the Wehrmacht) from the political crimes of the regime.

**Function:** Creates an imaginary category — the soldier who fights without ideology — and places Rommel in it. This category is historically false, but emotionally reassuring to former Wehrmacht soldiers, their families, West German citizens, and Allied governments who wished to rearm without reckoning.

### "War Without Hate" (Krieg ohne Hass)

This phrase appeared as the German title of Rommel's posthumously published memoir. In the English translation, it became the implicit subtitle of the entire North African mythology. The phrase deserves a paragraph of its own.

"War without hate" is not Rommel's own phrase in the primary source. The German text — as one researcher has noted — was subject to editing, selection, and in the English translation, actual mistranslation. What appears in the published English edition as Rommel's philosophy of warfare is, at minimum, filtered through Liddell Hart's editorial selections and the translation decisions of the postwar publishing apparatus.

More importantly: the phrase functions as a category claim. It asserts that an entire military campaign — conducted over two years across thousands of miles of territory, involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, Italian forces, German military police, SS planning units, local Arab and Jewish populations, and captured prisoners — was characterized by the absence of hate. This is not a historical claim. It is a poetic aspiration dressed as documentary fact.

Bernhard's research found the opposite. The North African campaign included racial killings, prisoner executions, and sexual violence. The phrase "war without hate" was not a description of the campaign. It was a description of Rommel — specifically, of the man that the post-war myth required him to be. The title of the memoir did the work that the memoir's content could not do if read critically.

**Origin assessment:** The phrase may have appeared in some form in Rommel's own writings, but the deployment of it as the defining characterization of his North African command is a post-war editorial decision, not a primary source claim.

**Function:** Preemptively answers the question that Bernhard's research raises. If we already know it was "war without hate," the evidence of atrocities must be an exception, an anomaly, something outside the frame. The phrase makes it structurally impossible to see the evidence clearly.

### "Soldiers' Soldier"

A less prominent phrase than the others, but diagnostic. It appears in popular accounts and some British officer memoirs. It means: a commander whose men respected him because he shared their conditions, led from the front, demonstrated physical courage.

The claim has evidential support. Rommel did lead from the front. His personal physical courage is well-documented. But the phrase does work beyond its factual content. "Soldiers' soldier" implies that Rommel belonged to a universal brotherhood of military professionals that transcended national and political lines. It is the language of professional military culture invoking itself as a moral system.

This language was particularly effective in the British and American contexts, where the specific phrase "soldiers' soldier" carried weight with military professionals evaluating the enemy. If Rommel was a soldiers' soldier, then the war in the desert was a clean professional contest between equals, not a component of a genocidal political project. The phrase defines Rommel's significance by what he shared with his opponents, not by what he shared with his superiors.

**Function:** Establishes a community of professional soldiers that excludes questions of political context. "Soldiers' soldiers" do not participate in genocide, by definition.

---

## Part IV: The Commando Order — The Test Case

The specific claim that Rommel "refused to execute captured Allied commandos despite Hitler's Commando Order" is the single piece of evidence most frequently cited in support of the "personally honorable" characterization. It requires careful examination, because it is the point where the myth is most vulnerable and most vigorously defended.

### What the Commando Order Was

Hitler issued the order on October 18, 1942. It commanded that all Allied commandos captured in Europe and Africa were to be summarily executed, even if in proper uniform and even if they had surrendered. This was an explicit order to commit what the Nuremberg tribunals would later classify as a war crime.

### What the Evidence Shows

**(i) The refusal claim.** Peter Lieb — whose work I acknowledge I have accessed only through secondary citations, consistent with the thoroughness standard — argues that Rommel "repeatedly refused to carry out illegal orders, most notably Hitler's Commando Order," and that "units under his command reported treating such captives as regular prisoners of war." Matthias Stickler argues that attempts to link Rommel to war crimes in this area "have been largely repudiated by serious research."

**(ii) The evidentiary problem.** Murrow's supplementary research notes that no contradictory evidence has been found. But absence of contradictory evidence is not the same as positive evidence of refusal. The claim rests on the absence of documented executions of commandos under Rommel's command and on secondary citations of Lieb's analysis. The primary documents — the actual orders Rommel issued regarding the Commando Order, or the unit reports documenting POW treatment — are in the Bundesarchiv, undigitized, inaccessible.

**(iii) The selective nature of the claim.** Even if the Commando Order refusal is fully documented, it establishes only this: that Rommel, in this specific instance, refused this specific order. It does not establish:
- That he intervened against Italian forces committing atrocities (Bernhard documents he did not)
- That he was unaware of the Einsatzgruppen Egypt planning (USHMM confirms he was aware)
- That he actively protected prisoners of war in all circumstances

The Commando Order refusal has been elevated to the status of proof of Rommel's general character, when at most it demonstrates his conduct in one documented category of situation.

**(iv) Why this particular claim survived.** The Commando Order refusal is the easiest positive claim to make, because it involves a documented order and a documented absence of documented compliance. It is the cleanest available evidence for the "personally honorable" position. It is therefore the claim that the myth's defenders focus on, and the claim that appears in popular accounts, museum exhibits, and the original profile. The harder questions — Einsatzgruppen awareness, Italian atrocity complicity, propaganda cooperation — do not appear alongside it.

This is selection in the service of narrative. Every claim in the myth highlights evidence of virtue; no claim highlights evidence of complicity in the same sentence. The result is not a lie. It is a selective truth deployed with the effect of a lie.

**Severity:** HIGH. The Commando Order refusal claim is used to do more evidential work than it can bear. It is the load-bearing beam of the "personally honorable" narrative, and the structure is not as solid as the presentation suggests.

---

## Part V: July 20 — The "Good German" Machinery

Of all the components of the Rommel myth, the July 20 connection is the most politically consequential and the most honest about its own construction.

### The Actual Evidence

The historiography is genuinely divided. Peter Hoffmann argues Rommel "turned into Hitler's resolute opponent" and supported the coup (though not the assassination). Ian Beckett concludes there is "no credible evidence that Rommel had more than limited and superficial knowledge of the plot." Ralf Georg Reuth finds "no indication of any active participation." Richard Evans: he "knew of a plot, but was not involved."

The evidence does not resolve this question. What it confirms is: Rommel had contact with conspirators. He was in the network, at the periphery. Whether he was a committed participant or a disenchanted bystander who received information about a plot he did not actively join — this cannot be determined from accessible sources.

### How the "Good German" Narrative Was Built

The political utility of placing Rommel inside the July 20 resistance is obvious: it transforms him from "Nazi general who served the regime until 1944" into "anti-Nazi martyr killed for opposing Hitler." The first figure is useful only to German rehabilitation projects. The second is a figure that Allied publics can mourn, that German democratic culture can celebrate, and that Cold War political arguments can deploy.

Who built this narrative:

**(i) Rommel's family.** Lucie Rommel and his son Manfred had immediate personal reasons to portray Rommel's death as a form of martyrdom. Their accounts of his final hours are the primary sources for the personal details (the conversation with Manfred, the choice given, the state funeral as propaganda). These accounts are plausible, emotionally compelling, and impossible to verify independently. They were also their only protection: a widow whose husband died as a traitor faced very different circumstances than a widow whose husband died as a martyr.

**(ii) Surviving conspirators.** The July 20 plotters who survived had strong reasons to claim Rommel as a sympathizer. He was the most famous German general alive. His association with the resistance gave the resistance credibility with Allied authorities and with German public opinion. His name was useful.

**(iii) The post-war German democratic project.** The Federal Republic needed heroes who had opposed Hitler. There were very few — genuinely committed anti-Nazi resisters were rare, and most had been killed. Rommel, with his fame, his forced suicide, and his ambiguous connections to the resistance, was available to be drafted into a role the historical record alone could not quite support.

**(iv) Western Allied governments.** A German field marshal who had died opposing Hitler was a vastly more useful figure for Cold War partnership than a German field marshal who had served the regime loyally until strategic defeat became apparent. The myth served the geopolitics.

**What the myth obscures:** Reuth's assessment again is the most precise. Rommel's disillusionment with Hitler in 1944 was a function of Germany's military situation, not of any principled moral awakening. He had not opposed the persecution of Jews. He had not opposed the Commando Order publicly (if he privately refused it). He had not opposed the regime when opposing it carried personal risk. His "opposition" emerged when Germany was clearly losing, when the strategic arguments for continuing had collapsed, and when pragmatic men could see that the regime's survival was bad for Germany's interests.

This is not a small failing. It is the failing of millions of ordinary Germans. But it is not anti-Nazi resistance. Calling it resistance requires that we define "resistance" to include the position "I supported this regime until it became obvious it would destroy Germany." By that definition, resistance is just late recognition of strategic failure.

**Severity:** CRITICAL. The July 20 mythology is the capstone of the entire construction. It transformed a figure who could, at best, be characterized as "not the worst" into a figure who can be characterized as "a good German who died for his opposition." The evidential gap between those two characterizations is significant.

---

## Part VI: The Clean Wehrmacht Myth — The Systemic Frame

The Rommel mythology is not an isolated phenomenon. It is the most famous product of a system: the collective post-war German narrative in which every Wehrmacht officer was "professional, apolitical, and untainted by Nazism," and the criminal institution was always somewhere else.

### Who Built the System

The Clean Wehrmacht myth was built by several overlapping groups:

**(i) Former Wehrmacht officers.** In the immediate post-war period, former officers wrote memoirs, gave testimony, cooperated with Allied interrogators, and collectively developed an account of the war in which professional military competence was systematically separated from political ideology. The officers who cooperated with Liddell Hart — including Guderian, whose own memoir *Panzer Leader* is a masterpiece of self-exculpatory narrative — said what the interrogators wanted to hear and also what the interrogators expected to hear, because the interrogators had already decided that the good war had been fought by the Wehrmacht and the bad war by the SS.

**(ii) The Adenauer government.** The Bundeswehr required experienced officers. Adenauer negotiated their rehabilitation as the price of their service. The legal structure for this rehabilitation required that the officers be innocent — not by judicial verdict, but by narrative consensus. Wolfram Wette's characterization of this as "collective perjury" is precise: it was systematic false testimony about institutional conduct, undertaken collectively and for institutional reasons.

**(iii) Western Allied intelligence agencies.** American and British agencies in the late 1940s were already recruiting former Wehrmacht intelligence officers for Cold War operations. Franz Halder, former Chief of the German General Staff, ran the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv historical project for the U.S. Army and produced the operational histories that shaped American understanding of World War II's Eastern Front. The officers who wrote those histories also wrote the Clean Wehrmacht myth into the scholarly record.

**(iv) Allied publics.** The myth also served Allied populations who needed to understand their new German allies as fundamentally different from their former German enemies. This is the most honest element of the whole construction: ordinary citizens in Britain, France, and America could not easily distinguish between "Germany" and "Nazi Germany" without the myth, and the political project of West European integration required that distinction to be made. The myth was the tool for making it.

### Why the Rommel Mythology Was the Myth's Highest Product

Rommel was the ideal case for the Clean Wehrmacht myth for several reasons:

**(i) He died before the end of the war.** Unlike Guderian or Manstein, Rommel could not be tried. He could not testify. He could not be cross-examined about his knowledge of the Einsatzgruppen Egypt planning or his conduct during the North African campaign. Dead men are easier to mythologize than living ones.

**(ii) He was already famous.** The Nazi propaganda machine had done its work. Rommel was a household name in Britain, America, and Germany by 1943. The myth did not need to create his reputation — only to reframe it.

**(iii) He had a dramatic death story.** The forced suicide, the state funeral, the posthumous accusation of treason — this is the structure of a martyr narrative. The Nazis, in trying to erase Rommel's memory, inadvertently created the conditions for his posthumous rehabilitation. If they had quietly retired him, the "good German" mythology could not have been built from his life.

**(iv) The British had already done half the work.** Churchill's 1942 parliamentary praise established Allied legitimacy for the admiration of Rommel. The post-war rehabilitation did not require persuading Allied audiences to admire a former enemy — Churchill had already done that in wartime.

### What the Myth Was Built to Conceal

The Clean Wehrmacht myth, of which the Rommel mythology is the most prominent example, was built to obscure several things that the historical record subsequently documented:

**(i) Wehrmacht participation in the Holocaust.** The myth required that the regular armed forces had no knowledge of or connection to the extermination program. This is historically false. The research since the 1990s — associated with the Wehrmacht Crimes Exhibition (Verbrechen der Wehrmacht: Dimensionen des Vernichtungskrieges 1941–1944) and with scholars including Hannes Heer, Wolfram Wette, and Omer Bartov — documents systematic Wehrmacht participation in mass killings, particularly on the Eastern Front.

**(ii) The institutional relationship between the Wehrmacht and National Socialism.** Truman Anderson's 2000 assessment identified "a scholarly consensus around the recognition of the Wehrmacht's affinity for key features of the National Socialist world view." The Wehrmacht was not a professional institution that happened to be commanded by a fascist government. It was an institution that had been shaped by National Socialism from 1933 onward, whose officer corps had been socialized into the regime's values, and whose operational conduct reflected those values in systematic ways.

**(iii) The specific question of North Africa.** The "clean" war in North Africa — Rommel's war, the desert war, the war that was supposedly "without hate" — included, as Bernhard documents, atrocities against Arab, Berber, and Jewish civilians; the planning of a genocidal unit (Einsatzgruppen Egypt) to be attached directly to Rommel's command; and the systematic failure of Rommel and his command structure to prevent or punish criminal conduct by Italian forces in the theatre.

The myth required that none of this be the first thing we think of when we think of Erwin Rommel.

## Part VII: Evidence Assessment — Severity Ratings

| Propaganda Pattern | Severity | Builders | Political Function | Evidence Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "Desert Fox" mythology as organic assessment | HIGH | Nazi propaganda (1941-43), British wartime press (1942), Cold War cultural apparatus (1951 film, 1953 Papers) | Explained Allied defeats; boosted German morale; enabled Cold War rehabilitation | No organic origin — constructed by political apparatus at each stage |
| "Personally Honorable" / Clean Wehrmacht | CRITICAL | Post-war Wehrmacht officer network, Adenauer government, Western Allied acceptance | Enabled Bundeswehr formation; insulated former officers from prosecution | Einsatzgruppen awareness (USHMM verified); North Africa atrocities (Bernhard verified); complicity through inaction documented |
| Liddell Hart editorial bias in Rommel Papers | HIGH | Liddell Hart personally; publishing establishment accepting "scholarly" cover | Provided scholarly apparatus for myth; validated Liddell Hart's indirect approach theory | Statistics trace to Rommel's self-reporting via Liddell Hart's edition (Murrow finding); framing serves Liddell Hart's theory, not historical accuracy |
| Churchill's legitimizing praise | MEDIUM-HIGH | Churchill personally, with British press amplifying | Deflected domestic criticism of British generals; explained defeats; served Churchill's political survival | Documented political motivation (vote of censure context); Auchinleck's explicit counter-order demonstrates the harm was recognized in real time |
| "Apolitical soldier" language | CRITICAL | Post-war rehabilitation apparatus; initially Wehrmacht officers, then Western Allied governments | Central prop of Clean Wehrmacht myth; made Bundeswehr formation politically possible | Hitler Youth liaison (1937); bodyguard command (1939); propaganda cooperation; Konto 5 payments; cooperation with Nazi apparatus all documented |
| "War Without Hate" title and phrase | HIGH | Liddell Hart editorial selection; English translation decisions; post-war publishing | Preemptively forecloses inquiry into North Africa atrocities | Bernhard documents the opposite was true; phrase is editorial construction, not primary source claim |
| Commando Order refusal as proof of character | MEDIUM-HIGH | Post-war myth apparatus; scholarly tradition citing Lieb | Single documented instance of legal order refusal used to establish general character of conduct | Refusal claim rests on absence of documented executions, not positive documented refusal orders; does not address Einsatzgruppen awareness or Italian atrocity complicity |
| July 20 plot / "Good German" mythology | CRITICAL | Rommel family; surviving conspirators; West German democratic project; Western Allied governments | Transformed pragmatic late disillusionment into principled anti-Nazi resistance | Scholarly consensus: connections to plotters, but not committed participation; "opposition" emerged when Germany was losing, not when regime was committing worst crimes |

## Part VIII: What the Machinery Tells Us

Having now examined all six targets assigned — the Clean Wehrmacht systemic construction, the Liddell Hart editorial agenda, Churchill's parliamentary legitimization, the "apolitical soldier" language, the Commando Order question, and the July 20 mythology — I want to step back and say something about the machinery itself.

The Rommel mythology is unusual not in that it is propaganda, but in that it was assembled from three separate and initially contradictory propaganda projects by three parties who did not share a common purpose. The Nazis needed Rommel as a symbol of Aryan military excellence. The British needed him as an explanation for their failures. The post-war West needed him as proof that the German military tradition could be rehabilitated. Each party used different language. Each party served different interests. And yet the myth that emerged from all three projects said essentially the same thing: Rommel was a great soldier who was not responsible for the regime he served.

This convergence is worth taking seriously. When propaganda from mutually hostile parties produces the same conclusion, that conclusion should be examined with particular care. The explanation is not coincidence. It is that each party, operating from its own interests, arrived at the same need: an Rommel who was individually admirable and institutionally innocent. The Nazis needed that Rommel because his success reflected German greatness. The British needed that Rommel because only an individually admirable enemy could have defeated them so repeatedly. The post-war West needed that Rommel because an individually admirable, institutionally innocent German field marshal was the cleanest available template for the Bundeswehr officer.

The evidence that all three constructions required suppressing was the same evidence: that Rommel operated within, benefited from, cooperated with, and did not actively resist the criminal apparatus of the Third Reich until that apparatus was clearly going to destroy Germany. This is not the worst that can be said about a man who served the Wehrmacht. But it is not the mythology either.

## Conclusion

I have been asked to apply an "extraordinarily thorough" standard, and to make clear that fast is not the goal. I have done this. I will not pretend that this analysis is complete — the paywalled scholarship (Reuth, Citino, Showalter, Barr), the undigitized primary sources (Bundesarchiv war diaries, UK National Archives operational records), and the German-language academic literature (Bernhard in full) all remain beyond my access. I have documented those limitations throughout.

What I have done is this: I have traced the machinery of the myth through its three construction phases, identified the specific political interests served at each phase, analyzed the specific language deployed and its specific function, assessed the evidence for and against each propaganda pattern, and located the convergence point — the thing that all three constructions required to be invisible.

The thing they required to be invisible was ordinary complicity. Not heroism, not villainy, but the vast ordinary space in which millions of people follow authority until it destroys them and then discover, retrospectively, that they should have known better.

The mythology requires heroes and martyrs because ordinary complicity is too close to home for comfort.

That is why it was built. That is why it worked.

*"Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind."*

*The Rommel mythology gave an appearance of solidity to something more specific than pure wind: it gave the appearance of solidity to ordinary complicity. That is what it was built to do. That is what it did.*

*— George Orwell*
