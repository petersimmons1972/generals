# Mission Brief: Rommel Thorough Standard Upgrade

**Operation**: Historical Audit - Phase 2
**Subject**: Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel
**Task**: Upgrade pilot research to thorough standard
**Lead Researcher**: Edward R. Murrow (Statistical Verification)
**Expected Duration**: 1-2 days
**Status**: Ready to start

---

## Context

**Existing research**: Pilot phase (completed 2026-02-11)
- Location: `/home/psimmons/projects/generals/historical-audit/pilot/rommel/`
- Accuracy: 85-90/100
- Methodology: Enhanced hybrid (summary-based + some primary sources)
- Propaganda patterns: Clean Wehrmacht myth identified, Rommel mythology documented

**Task**: Apply thorough standard (full primary source reading, explicit limitations)

## Primary Sources to Access IN FULL

### 1. Rommel's Afrika Korps War Diary
- Search German Federal Archive (Bundesarchiv)
- Search UK National Archives (captured German records)
- Read operational reports completely (not summaries)

### 2. British 8th Army Operational Records
- UK National Archives WO 201 series
- Montgomery's operational assessments of Rommel
- Auchinleck's reports
- Read complete documents

### 3. Rommel Papers (edited by Liddell Hart)
- Note: Tier 6-7 source (heavily edited)
- Compare to actual war diary if accessible
- Document Liddell Hart's editorial bias

### 4. Nuremberg Evidence
- Any Rommel-related testimony
- Assessment of Clean Wehrmacht claims
- Cross-reference with pilot findings

## Modern Scholarship (Post-2000) - FULL READING

1. **Showalter, Dennis. *Patton and Rommel* (2005)**
   - Google Books preview or library access
   - Read all accessible sections completely
   - Document % coverage

2. **Reuth, Ralf Georg. *Rommel: The End of a Legend* (2005)**
   - Critical biography challenging mythology
   - Open access or preview sections
   - Read completely where accessible

3. **Open-access academic papers**
   - Google Scholar: "Rommel" + "myth" + "Clean Wehrmacht"
   - Read 5-10 papers completely

---

## Verification Targets

**From pilot research, verify with primary sources**:

1. **Logistics blind spot** claim
   - Primary source: Afrika Korps war diary supply sections
   - Cross-verify with British intelligence assessments

2. **Tactical brilliance** claims
   - Primary source: British operational assessments (contemporary)
   - Compare pilot's "brilliant" claims with enemy assessments

3. **July 20 plot involvement**
   - Primary source: Gestapo interrogation records
   - Verify pilot's "unclear involvement" assessment

4. **Clean Wehrmacht myth**
   - Primary source: Any orders regarding civilians/POWs
   - Cross-verify pilot's findings

---

## Access Limitations to Document

**Expected paywalls**:
- Showalter (2005) - likely paywalled
- Reuth (2005) - likely paywalled
- Academic journals - subscription required

**Expected restrictions**:
- German archives - may require German language
- Some British records - may not be digitized

**Document explicitly**: What's accessible vs restricted, no false claims

---

## Deliverables

1. **sources-thorough-standard.md** - Access assessment for every source
2. **primary-sources-analysis.md** - Full reading of war diaries, operational records
3. **Updated pilot research** - Supplement with thorough standard findings
4. **Accuracy reassessment** - Update from 85-90/100 with documented gaps

---

## Success Criteria

- All accessible primary sources (war diaries, operational records) read IN FULL
- Paywalled sources documented explicitly
- Evidence chains for all pilot claims traced to primary sources
- Clean Wehrmacht myth verified/updated from primary sources
- Accuracy rating updated with access limitations noted

**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Standard**: THOROUGH (full reading, explicit limitations)
