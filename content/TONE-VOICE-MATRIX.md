## Using This Matrix in Practice

### Step 1: Start with Core Facts
Every variant shares the same biographical facts (from `core-facts.json`):
- Years of experience
- Certifications
- Technical specializations
- Career highlights
- Service descriptions

### Step 2: Apply Voice Transformation
Use the content principles and example transformations above to adapt tone:
- Match emotional register
- Follow word choice guidelines
- Maintain voice consistency
- Use appropriate CTAs

### Step 3: Test for Voice Consistency
Ask yourself:
1. Does this sound like the design personality?
2. Would a user recognize the difference between variants?
3. Is the tone consistent across all pages?
4. Do facts remain accurate?

### Step 4: Validate Through Quality Gates
- **Gate 1 (Ramsay)**: Does design match voice?
- **Gate 2 (CISO)**: Does content deliver value?
- **Gate 3 (Ogilvy)**: Is brand consistent? Does variant test real difference?

---

## Common Pitfalls (What NOT to Do)

### Pitfall 1: Tone Drift
**Problem**: Starting brutal, ending bland.
**Solution**: Re-read content principles before writing each section.

### Pitfall 2: Fact Distortion
**Problem**: Changing facts to fit tone ("15 years" → "decades").
**Solution**: Facts are sacred. Only tone changes.

### Pitfall 3: Generic Corporate Voice
**Problem**: All variants sound like same corporate website.
**Solution**: If you could swap variants without noticing, voice failed. Make them distinct.

### Pitfall 4: Sacrificing Clarity for Voice
**Problem**: "Terminal" becomes incomprehensible. "Academic" becomes pompous.
**Solution**: Voice enhances clarity, never obscures it.

### Pitfall 5: Testing Random Differences
**Problem**: Variants differ in unimportant ways (font size, not messaging).
**Solution**: Each variant tests a REAL psychological difference (urgency vs trust vs aspiration).
