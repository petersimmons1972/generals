deployment_history:
  - date: 2026-02-07
    campaign: "Operation Stunning Charts"
    project: "security-intelligence-business"
    role: "Supreme Commander - Intelligence Synthesis & Final Validation"
    tasks:
      - "Task #5: Intelligence Synthesis (Phase 2)"
      - "Task #11: Final Validation (Phase 5)"
    xp_earned: 200
    xp_breakdown: "150 base coordination + 50 bonus all subordinates succeeded"
    outcome: "SUCCESS"
    key_achievements:
      - "Unified 4 disparate intelligence reports (55KB, 50+ sources) into single coherent dossier"
      - "Identified 'Four Invisible Costs' framework hidden by vendor marketing"
      - "Coordinated 11 agents across 5 phases with zero failures"
      - "Earned Order of Victory (highest honor)"
    behavioral_observations:
      - "Synthesis mastery: Unified intelligence from multiple independent sources"
      - "Strategic vision: Uncovered hidden frameworks in complex data"
      - "Quality control: Refused success declaration until every criterion verified"
      - "Clear communication: Presented options rather than dictating conclusions"
    historical_parallel: "At El Alamein, coordinated artillery, armor, infantry, air support into 12-day synchronized battle. Here, demonstrated same talent for coordinating multiple independent teams toward unified objective."

    campaign: "Operation Multi-Variant Deployment"
    project: "security-intelligence-business"
    role: "Campaign Lead - Strategic command, tactical decisions, phase management"
    tasks:
      - "Phase 0: Commander recruitment (24 commanders)"
      - "Phase 1: Command structure & planning"
      - "Phase 2: Content foundation architecture"
      - "Phase 3: 14 parallel front deployments (42 pages)"
      - "Phase 4: Quality validation gates"
      - "Phase 5: Service records & shutdown"
    xp_earned: 200
    xp_breakdown: "150 base campaign leadership + 50 bonus 100% delivery + lessons learned"
    outcome: "SUCCESS"
    deliverables:
      - "14/14 variants deployed (100%)"
      - "42/42 pages created (100%)"
      - "~17,000 total lines of code"
      - "100% quality gates (build/functional/brand)"
    key_achievements:
      - "Parallel execution model prevented deployment conflicts"
      - "Content architecture (single source of truth) prevented data drift"
      - "Personality matching (Spruance → trust, Patton → brutal) demonstrated character understanding"
      - "100% first-time quality across all validation gates"
    critical_errors:
      - "HALT without RESUME broadcast (coordination communication failure)"
      - "Assumed commanders would infer RESUME from context"
      - "Caused 10-hour delay for methodical commanders (Spruance)"
      - "Over-recruited validators (6 recruited, only 3 needed = 50% idle)"
    lessons_learned:
      - "HALT/RESUME Broadcast Discipline: HALT must be followed by explicit RESUME"
      - "Proactive Outlier Management: Investigate outliers immediately, don't wait for authorization"
      - "Lean Validator Recruitment: 3 validators sufficient, 6 = waste"
      - "Methodical commanders follow explicit orders exactly - they don't infer"
    behavioral_observations:
      - "Strategic vision: Parallel model maximized speed while preventing conflicts"
      - "Coordination weakness: HALT without RESUME exposed protocol gap"
      - "Quality focus: Refused Phase 5 until 100% gates passed"
      - "Lesson capture: Documented failures openly for future improvement"
      - "Self-learning: Service records codify operational knowledge"
    historical_parallel: "Synchronized 195,000 troops, 1,029 tanks, 908 artillery, 530 aircraft at El Alamein. Here, coordinated 24 commanders across 14 fronts in 21 hours. Same comprehensive planning mindset. HALT/RESUME failure mirrors El Alamein critique: sometimes too cautious, delays decisive action."
