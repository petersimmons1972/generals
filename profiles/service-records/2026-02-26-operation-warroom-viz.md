# SERVICE RECORD: Operation Warroom Viz

**Campaign Date**: 2026-02-26
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Mission**: Generate 60 unique visualization/illustration ideas for Clearwatch EDR reports — 12 generals, 5 ideas each — compiled into a single HTML review page.
**Result**: SUCCESS

---

## Campaign Overview

**Objective**: Produce 60 creative, non-duplicating visualization concepts for EDR vendor comparison reports targeting 1–3 person IT teams making $50K–$150K decisions. All ideas must use only verified primary source data. No hallucinated data.

**Team Structure**:
- Team Lead: Founder (Clearwatch project owner)
- Commanders Deployed: Halsey, MacArthur, Layton, Mitchell, Dowding, Spruance, Pyle, Ogilvy, Orwell, Slim, LeMay, Zhukov
- Support Staff: None

**Phases**:
1. Phase 0: Team creation (`operation-warroom-viz`) and spawn instructions
2. Phase 1: Parallel idea generation — all 12 generals simultaneously, Opus model
3. Phase 2: HTML compilation — all 60 ideas on single review page
4. Phase 3: Service records

## Commander Performance

### Halsey (Sonnet — model error)
**Assignment**: 5 aggressive, competitive-intel-focused visualization ideas
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — Vendor Momentum Meter, Threat Velocity Scatter Plot, Competitive Pressure Gauge, Kill Chain Velocity Chart, Market Position Drift Map
**Quality**: Strong despite Sonnet (not Opus as directed)
**Note**: Spawned on Sonnet before model correction. Could not stop mid-execution.
**XP Earned**: 75 (Visualization/Charts) — delivery successful, model error not commander's fault

### MacArthur
**Assignment**: 5 strategic visionary ideas — big-picture, future-state, dramatic
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — The Sovereignty Spectrum, The Defender's Hourglass, The Vendor Commitment Matrix, The Capability Cliff, The Breach Insurance Actuarial Table
**Quality**: Opus-quality strategic depth; Sovereignty Spectrum is genuinely novel
**XP Earned**: 75

### Layton
**Assignment**: 5 intelligence analysis ideas — SIGINT-style, pattern recognition, data triangulation
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — The Dwell Time Clock, Vendor Reliability Index, Detection Gap Intelligence Map, Vendor Trust Erosion Pattern, The False Positive Tax
**Quality**: Methodical, data-rigorous; Dwell Time Clock directly parallel to Zhukov's Breach Clock (different frame)
**XP Earned**: 75

### Mitchell
**Assignment**: 5 unconventional format ideas — challenge orthodoxy, force multipliers
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — The Silent Kill Chain, The Vendor Blind Spot Map, Platform Fragmentation Tax, EDR Operational Tempo, The Adversary's Perspective
**Quality**: Genuinely unconventional framing; Adversary's Perspective is a standout
**XP Earned**: 75

### Dowding
**Assignment**: 5 systems integration ideas — interoperability, defense mesh, integrated defense
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — Integration Web, Defense Mesh Density, Platform Consolidation Dividend, API Ecosystem Map, SIEM/SOAR Connection Cost
**Quality**: Technical depth; Integration Web is immediately actionable for IT buyer
**XP Earned**: 75

### Spruance
**Assignment**: 5 evidence-rigorous ideas — methodical, cite everything, analytical clarity
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — MITRE ATT&CK Coverage Heatmap Rebuke, Independent Test Score Timeline, Vendor Claim vs. Independent Reality Matrix, Detection Rate Confidence Intervals, Cost-Per-True-Positive
**Quality**: Most analytically rigorous contributions; Vendor Claim vs. Independent Reality is devastating
**XP Earned**: 75

### Pyle
**Assignment**: 5 human narrative ideas — ground-level, IT manager's lived experience
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — The Midnight Alert, Your Team's Security Workweek, The New-Hire Onboarding Race, The Renewal Conversation, The Breach Survivor Story
**Quality**: Most emotionally resonant; Midnight Alert directly parallel to Zhukov's Midnight Scenario (different medium — still unique)
**XP Earned**: 75

### Ogilvy
**Assignment**: 5 buyer psychology ideas — persuasion, framing, decision triggers
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — The Decision Regret Calculator, The Trusted Advisor Score, The Vendor Honeymoon Curve, The Switching Cost Reality Check, The Peer Benchmark Card
**Quality**: Sharpest understanding of buyer psychology; Regret Calculator is a standout
**XP Earned**: 75

### Orwell
**Assignment**: 5 truth-vs-spin ideas — detect mythology, expose vendor language games
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — The Marketing Claim Autopsy, The Fine Print Decoder, The Pricing Transparency Index, The Vendor-Speak Glossary, The Commitment Reality Check
**Quality**: Most skeptical voice; Marketing Claim Autopsy is uniquely valuable for this audience
**XP Earned**: 75

### Slim
**Assignment**: 5 practical innovation ideas — constrained resources, work under pressure
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — The Minimum Viable Security Stack, The Vendor Handoff Map, The IT Generalist's Competency Radar, The "Day 91" Reality Check, The Cost of Staying Put
**Quality**: Best audience empathy; IT Generalist's Competency Radar shows clear understanding of 1–3 person team
**XP Earned**: 75

### LeMay
**Assignment**: 5 precision efficiency ideas — maximum effectiveness, no waste
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — Alert Noise vs. Signal Ratio, Breach Math Scorecard, Analyst Hour Burn Rate, Detection Speed Payoff, 5-Year Decision Ledger
**Quality**: Most quantitatively precise; Analyst Hour Burn Rate is viscerally effective
**XP Earned**: 75

### Zhukov
**Assignment**: 5 operational sequence ideas — timelines, swim lanes, process flows
**Delivery**: 5 ideas — Breach Clock, Response Swim Lanes, Deployment March, Alert Triage Funnel, Midnight Scenario
**Quality**: Best operational clarity; Response Swim Lanes directly answers buyer's Friday-night fear
**XP Earned**: 75

## What Worked ✅

1. **Parallel Opus execution across 12 generals**
   - Why it worked: Each general had a distinct creative lens preventing overlap; all used the same verified data pool preventing hallucination
   - Replicable: Yes — assign each general a different analytical angle

2. **Verified data briefing provided to all generals**
   - Why it worked: Gave every general the same facts, preventing fabrication while enabling individual framing
   - Replicable: Always brief generals with verified data pool before creative tasks

3. **Single HTML review page compilation**
   - Why it worked: Color-coded by general (12 accent colors), compact card format, all 60 visible without navigation
   - Replicable: Use CSS custom properties per section for visual differentiation

---

## What Failed ❌

1. **Halsey spawned on Sonnet (model error)**
   - Root cause: Model correction ("Jump up to Opus Thinking") came after Halsey was already spawned
   - Impact: One of 12 generals ran on Sonnet; ideas still usable but potentially less deep
   - Prevention: Confirm model level BEFORE spawning first general

2. **Named generals not used initially (workflow violation)**
   - Root cause: Used alphabetic codes (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie) before AGENTS.md was checked
   - Impact: Three agents stopped and respawned; wasted tokens
   - Prevention: Always read AGENTS.md before spawning any generals team

## Lessons Learned

### **Lesson 1: Creative parallel swarms need distinct angles, not distinct topics**
**What we discovered**: 12 generals generating ideas about the same domain (EDR charts) didn't produce 12 redundant sets — they produced 60 distinct ideas — because each general had a different analytical lens (psychology, precision, narrative, systems, etc.)
**Application**: For future parallel creative work, assign creative angle rather than content domain

### **Lesson 2: Verified data pool prevents fabrication in creative tasks**
**What we discovered**: Providing all generals with the same verified data set (MITRE MSS, IBM breach, pricing data) meant zero hallucinations across 60 ideas
**Application**: Always brief creative agents with verified source data before ideation
