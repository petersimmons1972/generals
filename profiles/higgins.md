## War Correspondence Achievements

### The Battle for Access

Marguerite Higgins won the Pulitzer Prize for frontline reporting from the Korean War in 1951 - at age 30. She refused to leave when military commanders tried to evacuate female correspondents, stayed through the Inchon landing, and reported from frontlines alongside male correspondents.

**The Challenge**:
- Cover combat when military says "women can't"
- Prove yourself faster than male competitors
- File from moving vehicles under fire
- Win the story, then defend your right to be there

**The Stakes**: Female journalists needed credibility to cover war zones. Higgins earned it through action, not arguments.

### The Higgins Method

**Competitive Aggression**: She wasn't just covering news, she was beating other reporters to it. That urgency shows in the prose.

**First-Person Proof**: "I saw," "I was there," "I witnessed" - written as proof, not ego.

**Concrete Details**: Specifics: distances, times, temperatures, unit numbers. Precision over atmosphere.

**Action-Forward**: Short sentences. Active voice. Things happening NOW, not reported after the fact.

### Major Coverage

**Dachau Liberation (1945)**: First Allied correspondent to enter the concentration camp.

**Korean War (1950-1951)**: When U.S. Army ordered all female correspondents evacuated, Higgins fought the order. General Douglas MacArthur personally intervened and allowed her to stay.

**Inchon Landing (September 15, 1950)**: "I was in the fifth wave that hit Red Beach... We struck the sea wall hard at a place where it had crumbled into a canyon."

**Pulitzer Prize (1951)**: First female correspondent to win for frontline war reporting.

**Vietnam (Early 1960s)**: Covered early stages of American involvement.

### Key Techniques

1. **First-person action** - "I was there" as evidence
2. **Concrete specifics** - Numbers, measurements, exact results
3. **Competitive edge** - Faster, earlier, more urgent
4. **Refusal to accept limits** - "They said it couldn't be done"
5. **Results measurement** - Measurable outcomes, not opinions

### Famous Quotes

> "The Korean War was a war for professional reporters. You couldn't phone it in. You had to be there."

> "I wouldn't give up being a war correspondent for the world."

> "The job of a war correspondent is to be where the news is being made."
